# MVP: Key Talking Points

## 1. Introduction to MVP
- **What is an MVP?** A ridiculously simple version of your product
- **Purpose:** The first thing you give to initial users to deliver any value
- **Common mistake:** Overthinking and overbuilding your MVP

## 2. Pre-MVP Research
- Talk to some users before building (not extensive research)
- Ideal scenario: You are your own user
- Understanding who has the problem is crucial
- If you can't identify users, question your approach

## 3. Core Goals of Early Startups
- **Launch quickly** - "Launch something bad, quickly"
- **Get initial customers** - Anyone using your product
- **Talk to users** - Collect feedback on your MVP
- **Iterate** - Improve your solution based on feedback

## 4. The Guiding Philosophy
- Hold the problem you're solving tightly
- Hold the customer tightly
- Hold the solution you're building loosely

## 5. Iteration vs. Pivoting
- Focus on improving your solution for the original problem
- Don't look for different problems your solution might solve
- The screwdriver analogy: Fix your tool, not your target

## 6. Characteristics of a Lean MVP
- Built in weeks, not months
- Extremely limited functionality
- Focused on highest-priority problems
- Starting point for iteration, not a finished product

## 7. Real-World Examples
- **Airbnb:** No payments, no map view, part-time developer
- **Twitch:** One channel, low resolution, no gaming focus
- **Stripe:** Minimal features, founders personally installed it

## 8. When You Need a "Heavy MVP"
- Regulated industries (insurance, banking)
- Hard tech (rockets, drones)
- Biotech and moonshots
- Still start with a simple website (days, not weeks)

## 9. Redefining "Launch"
- Launches aren't special moments
- Distinguish between:
  * Getting any customers (do ASAP)
  * Press launch (can wait)

## 10. Why Launch Quickly?
- Theory and research have limits
- Real learning comes from user interaction
- You can't know if your solution works until users try it
- "Until you can put something in front of people, you have no idea whether it's gonna work."

## 11. MVP Building Hacks
- Time box your spec (e.g., "What can I build in 3 weeks?")
- Write your spec down
- Cut features ruthlessly, even important ones
- Don't fall in love with your MVP

## 12. Founder Pitfalls to Avoid
- Asking users for features instead of understanding problems
- Getting stuck in an endless cycle of changing your MVP
- Focusing solely on growth or retention (both matter)
- Mistaking any usage for product-market fit

## 13. Key Takeaways
- Launch something bad, quickly
- Get real users interacting with your product
- Focus on solving a problem, not building features
- Keep iterating until you solve the problem
- Vision big, MVP small
