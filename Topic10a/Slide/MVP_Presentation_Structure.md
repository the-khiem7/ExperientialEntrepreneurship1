# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Presentation

## Slide 1: Title
**Title:** How to Plan an MVP
**Subtitle:** Launch Something Bad, Quickly
**Speaker Notes:**
- Introduce yourself and your background
- Acknowledge the term "MVP" as startup jargon but explain its importance
- Set the tone: This presentation is about simplicity and speed

## Slide 2: Definition of MVP
**Content:**
- "Something ridiculously simple"
- First thing you give to your very first target users
- Goal: Deliver any value at all to them

**Speaker Notes:**
- Emphasize the simplicity aspect
- Explain that many founders overthink their MVPs
- The goal is to test if your solution provides value

## Slide 3: Before You Build
**Content:**
- Talk to some users (not years of research)
- Ideally, be your own user
- Know exactly who has the problem

**Speaker Notes:**
- Explain that user conversations are valuable but don't need to be extensive
- Being your own user gives you faster feedback cycles
- If you can't identify who has the problem, reconsider your approach
- "If you are building a product for a mysterious set of users that you have no idea who they are, question that slightly."

## Slide 4: Pre-launch Goals
**Content:** Three simple steps:
1. Launch quickly
2. Get initial customers
3. Collect feedback
4. Iterate on your solution

**Speaker Notes:**
- Emphasize "launch something bad, quickly" as the key takeaway
- Many founders never get a single user to interact with their product
- Getting any feedback is better than theoretical perfection

## Slide 5: The Golden Rule
**Content:**
- "Hold the problem you're solving tightly"
- "Hold the customer tightly"
- "Hold the solution you're building loosely"

**Speaker Notes:**
- Explain why the solution should be flexible
- The problem and customer are your constants
- Your initial solution is likely wrong in some ways

## Slide 6: Iterate, Don't Pivot Prematurely
**Content:**
- Iteration: Improving your solution for the same problem/users
- Pivoting: Finding different problems for your solution
- The screwdriver analogy

**Speaker Notes:**
- Many founders fall in love with their solution
- When it doesn't work, they look for different problems it could solve
- Instead, keep the same problem and users, but fix your solution
- "If your screwdriver doesn't help the mechanic, keep the mechanic, keep the problem, fix the screwdriver."

## Slide 7: Building a Lean MVP
**Content:**
- Build in weeks, not months
- Extremely limited functionality
- Focus on highest-priority problems
- Just a base to iterate from

**Speaker Notes:**
- Some founders can start with just a landing page and spreadsheet
- Condense user needs to the most essential functions
- Don't try to solve all problems for all users initially
- The MVP isn't special - it's just a starting point

## Slide 8: Example - Airbnb (2008)
**Content:**
- Show early landing page
- Missing features:
  • No payments (cash in person)
  • No map view
  • Part-time development

**Speaker Notes:**
- Highlight how even successful companies started with significant limitations
- Contrary to popular belief, Airbnb wasn't perfect from the beginning
- They focused on the core value: connecting travelers with places to stay

## Slide 9: Example - Twitch
**Content:**
- Show Justin.tv screenshot
- One channel only (Justin's life)
- Low resolution video
- No video games focus

**Speaker Notes:**
- Explain Twitch's origins as a reality TV channel
- The video quality was so poor you could barely recognize faces
- The pivot to gaming came much later
- Now it's a billion-dollar platform

## Slide 10: Example - Stripe
**Content:**
- Original name: /dev/payments
- No bank deals
- Almost no features
- Founders would personally install it

**Speaker Notes:**
- Stripe's initial product was extremely basic
- Founders would come to your office and integrate it for you
- This helped them get users and find bugs early
- Now it's one of the most valuable fintech companies

## Slide 11: When You Need a "Heavy MVP"
**Content:**
Industries requiring more upfront work:
- Highly regulated (insurance, banking)
- Hard tech (rockets, drones)
- Biotech
- Moonshots

**Speaker Notes:**
- Acknowledge some industries have higher barriers to entry
- Even in these cases, start with a simple website explaining your concept
- You can build this in days, not weeks
- The principle of starting simple still applies

## Slide 12: Rethinking "Launches"
**Content:**
- Most people can't remember when Google/Facebook/Twitter launched
- Two types of launches:
  • Getting any customers (do ASAP)
  • Press launch (can wait)

**Speaker Notes:**
- Launches aren't as special as founders think
- Big company launches create false expectations
- Focus on getting customers, not press attention
- The first type of launch should happen as soon as possible

## Slide 13: Why Launch Quickly?
**Content:**
- Research without a product = limited insights
- You need real interaction data
- The sooner you launch, the sooner you learn

**Speaker Notes:**
- Talking to users is good, but seeing them use your product is better
- You can't know if your solution works until users try it
- A pitch deck is less valuable than a working prototype
- "Until you can put something in front of people, you have no frigging idea whether it's gonna work."

## Slide 14: MVP Building Hacks
**Content:**
1. Time box your spec (e.g., "What can I build in 3 weeks?")
2. Write your spec down
3. Cut your spec ruthlessly
4. Don't fall in love with your MVP

**Speaker Notes:**
- Time boxing forces you to focus on what's essential
- Writing things down creates accountability
- Be willing to cut even important features to launch sooner
- Remember your MVP is just step one, like a first-grade paper

## Slide 15: FAQ - Key Questions
**Content:**
- How to handle users asking for different features
- When to change your MVP vs. staying focused
- How to collect useful feedback
- How to know when you have product-market fit

**Speaker Notes:**
- Never ask users for features; ask them about problems
- Stop changing your MVP if you're in an endless cycle
- With true product-market fit, your main challenge becomes keeping up with demand
- Most startups never achieve true product-market fit

## Slide 16: Key Takeaways
**Content:**
- Launch something bad, quickly
- Get real users using your product
- Focus on solving problems, not features
- Iterate until you solve the problem

**Speaker Notes:**
- Reiterate the main message: launch quickly
- The path from A to Z isn't clear in startups
- Focus on solving the problem right in front of you
- Keep the vision big, but the MVP small

## Slide 17: Q&A / Contact
**Content:**
- Questions?
- Contact information
- Resources for further reading

**Speaker Notes:**
- Open the floor for questions
- Provide ways for audience to follow up
- Thank the audience for their time
