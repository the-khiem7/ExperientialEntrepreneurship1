# Slide Guidelines: How to Plan an MVP

## Slide 1: Title Slide
- Title: "How to Plan an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)"
- Subtitle: "Launch Something Bad, Quickly"
- Speaker: Michael, Y Combinator

## Slide 2: What is an MVP?
- Definition: "Something ridiculously simple"
- Purpose: The first thing you can give to your very first users
- Goal: See if you can deliver any value at all to them
- Quote: "When you think about an MVP, you should think about something ridiculously simple."

## Slide 3: Before Building Your MVP
- Talk to some users (not years of research)
- Be your own user when possible
- Know who has the problem you're solving
- Target users you can access

## Slide 4: Goals of a Pre-launch Startup
1. Launch quickly
2. Get initial customers using your product
3. Talk to users and get feedback
4. Iterate on your solution

## Slide 5: Key Principle
- Quote: "Hold the problem you're solving tightly, hold the customer tightly, hold the solution you're building loosely."
- Visual: Illustration showing tight grip on problem/customer, loose grip on solution

## Slide 6: Iteration vs. Pivoting
- Iteration: Keep improving your solution for the same problem and users
- Pivoting: Looking for different problems your solution might solve
- Quote: "If your screwdriver doesn't help the mechanic solve the problem, keep the mechanic, keep the problem, fix the screwdriver."

## Slide 7: Building a Lean MVP
- Build fast (weeks, not months)
- Extremely limited functionality
- Focus on highest-order problems for initial users
- Remember: It's just a base to iterate from

## Slide 8: Real Examples - Airbnb (2008)
- Image: Early Airbnb landing page
- Missing features:
  - No payments integration
  - No map view
  - Part-time developer
- Outcome: Billion-dollar company

## Slide 9: Real Examples - Twitch
- Image: Justin.tv screenshot (Twitch's predecessor)
- Initial limitations:
  - Single channel (Justin's life)
  - Low resolution video
  - No video game focus
- Outcome: Billion-dollar company

## Slide 10: Real Examples - Stripe
- Image: /dev/payments (Stripe's original name)
- Initial limitations:
  - No bank deals
  - Almost no features
  - Manual integration by founders
- Outcome: Billion-dollar company

## Slide 11: When You Need a "Heavy MVP"
- Industries with significant regulation (insurance, banking)
- Hard tech (rockets, drones)
- Biotech
- Moonshots
- Still start with: Simple website explaining what you do (days, not weeks)

## Slide 12: The Reality of Launching
- Launches aren't special (no one remembers when Google/Facebook/Twitter launched)
- Define two types of launches:
  - Getting any customers (do this ASAP)
  - Press launch (can wait)
- Quote: "The number one thing that's really important is to get some customers."

## Slide 13: Why Launch Quickly?
- Learning requires a product users can try
- Research without a product = limited insights
- Quote: "Until you can put something in front of people, you have no frigging idea whether it's gonna work."

## Slide 14: Hacks for Building an MVP Quickly
1. Time box your spec (e.g., "What can I build in 3 weeks?")
2. Write your spec (make it concrete)
3. Cut your spec (even important things if needed)
4. Don't fall in love with your MVP

## Slide 15: Key Takeaways
- Launch something bad, quickly
- Get real users interacting with your product
- Focus on solving a problem, not building features
- Keep iterating until you solve the problem

## Slide 16: Q&A Highlights
- Focus on understanding user problems, not collecting feature requests
- Don't get stuck in an endless cycle of changing your MVP
- Both growth and retention matter
- Product-market fit is obvious when you have it

## Slide 17: Thank You / Contact
- Thank you slide
- Contact information
