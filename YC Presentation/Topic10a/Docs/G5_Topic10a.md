# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
*A talk by Michael from Y Combinator*

## Introduction

My name is Michael. I work here at Y Combinator. I help run the accelerator. Before that, I did two YC startups, one in 2007 and one in 2012. And today, I'm gonna talk to you about minimum viable product, so MVP.

We always yell at founders to not use jargon, yet we have this whole set of stupid startup jargon, and MVP is one of them. When you think about an MVP, you should think about something **ridiculously simple**. This is the first thing you can give to the very first set of users you wanna target, in order to see if you can deliver any value at all to them. That's all it is. It's extremely simple.

## Talking to Users Before Building

I know you guys had a talk last week about how to come up with ideas, how to come up with problems you want to solve. What I will tell you is that it is helpful to talk to some users before you decide to build your MVP. This doesn't mean you have to go into a three year research situation, or you have to work in industry for 10 years. But some conversations are helpful. 

It's even more helpful if you're your own user, so you can tell whether your product's working for you. I always get this strange question of how do I get my first users, which always kind of confuses me because theoretically, you decide to solve a problem that you know someone has. So the way you get your first users, you talk to that person that you know has the problem. And if it's you, it's even easier.

*If you are building a product for a mysterious set of users that you have no idea who they are, question that slightly. Very slightly.*

## Goals of a Pre-launch Startup

The goal of a prelaunch startup is extremely simple:

1. **Launch quickly**. This is something that's been part of the YC ethos from the very beginning, and it's been great advice for 10 years, and it continues to be great advice. If you can walk away from one thing from this presentation, it's **launch something bad, quickly**.

2. **Get some initial customers**. Get anyone using your product. You don't have to have a vision of how you get everyone using it, but just anyone interacting and seeing if they get value out of the product. You'd be surprised at how many founders' journeys end before a single user has actually interacted with a product they've created. It's very, very common.

3. **Talk to your users** after you've launched this MVP, and get feedback. Most founders have an idea in their heads of what they wanna build. And so they think if they haven't built the full thing yet, getting feedback on the initial version is useless. "Of course, it's not gonna work. It's not the full thing." 

   The reality is that the full thing is this idea in your head that should be flexible, because it might turn out the full thing that you wanna build isn't what your customers want at all. So, I have this saying:
   
   > *Hold the problem you're solving tightly, hold the customer tightly, hold the solution you're building loosely.*

4. **Iterate**. I like to distinguish between iterating and pivoting. A lot of founders, once they've figured out how to build something, fall in love with it. And if it doesn't work for a certain set of users, they start thinking, "Well, I wonder what other problems this thing can solve?"
   
   If your screwdriver doesn't help the mechanic solve the problem, keep the mechanic, keep the problem, and fix the screwdriver. The broken thing is not the mechanic, and it's not the fact that they need to screw something in. Continue improving on your solution until it actually solves the problem.

## Building a Lean MVP

In most cases, most people should be building a very lean MVP:

- **Build it fast** - in weeks, not months. This can either involve software, or honestly, we see startups just start with a landing page and a spreadsheet.

- **Extremely limited functionality** - You need to condense down what your initial user needs to a very simple set of things. Don't try to address all of their problems and all of their potential users. Focus on a small set of initial users and their highest-order problems.

- **Just a base to iterate from** - That's it. It's just a starting point. It's not special in any way. You just have to start.

## Real World Examples

### Airbnb (2008)
- No payments - When you found place to stay on Airbnb, you had to exchange money with the host in person
- No map view
- The person writing all the code, Nate, was working part time

### Twitch (Justin.tv)
- Started as only one channel - Justin's life
- Extremely low resolution video
- No video games (except if they played them in the apartment)

### Stripe (/dev/payments)
- No bank deals
- Almost no features
- Stripe founders would come to your office and integrate it for you

These are just three examples of extremely simple, extremely fast-to-build MVPs. All of these are billion-dollar companies, and they all started with something that most people would say is pretty basic.

## Heavy MVP

In very few cases, you have to build a "heavy MVP":

- Industries with significant regulation (insurance, banking, sometimes drones)
- Hard tech (building rockets)
- Biotech (inventing cancer drugs)
- Moonshots (boring tunnels, etc.)

If you're in that situation, your MVP can start with a simple website that explains what you do. It's helpful when you talk to people that they can refer back to something. You can build that simple website in days, not weeks.

## The Reality of Launching

Many founders have misconceptions about launching. They see big companies launch stuff and assume that's what startups do. 

But ask yourself: How many people remember the day that Google launched? Facebook? Twitter? Launches aren't that special at all.

I suggest different terminology:
- **Launch** = when you get any customers
- **Press launch** = when people write about it and you get buzz

Push the press launch off, and push the get-any-customers launch really soon.

It's much harder to learn from your customers when they don't have a product they can play with. You can talk to your customer all day, but you have no idea whether the thing you wanna build can solve their problem until you put it in front of them.

## Hacks for Building an MVP Quickly

1. **Time box your spec** - Say, "What if I want to launch in three weeks?" Then the only things on your spec are things you can build in three weeks.

2. **Write your spec** - It's easy to change what you're working on before you launch if you never write it down. If you write it down, at least you can be honest with yourself that you're changing your spec.

3. **Cut your spec** - A week into your sprint, you'll probably realize you added too many things. That's okay. Cut the non-important things. If there's nothing non-important, start cutting important things.

4. **Don't fall in love with your MVP** - So many people fall in love with the vision in their head. None of the products I showed you before became what was initially envisioned. Your MVP is just step one in a journey.

## Q&A

**Q: I'm finding, talking to users, I have several subtype segments, and each wants a particular thing. The numbers are so small that they kind of even out.**

**A:** Never ask users for features. Never ask users to tell you what they want. That's your job. The user's job is to give you problems. I would assume there's some continuity in the problems they have. They probably have no idea how to solve the problem and are giving you features they think might work.

Focus on questions like:
- What is your problem?
- How often do you experience it?
- How intense is it?
- Are you willing to pay for a solution?
- Do you know other people who have the problem?

**Q: I find myself changing my MVP constantly based on user feedback. When do I stop and just launch?**

**A:** Just stop changing it. One reason you might keep changing your MVP is because you think it's special. If you didn't think it was special, you would stop changing it. If you assume it has to be really basic, you'll spend less time tinkering with it.

**Q: After launching an MVP, what are the key things to ask users?**

**A:** Does it solve the problem I want it to solve? That's it. Often you don't have to ask - you can observe if they're doing the thing you want them to do. If it's a problem they have every day, and you introduce a user to it, did they come back the next day?

**Q: How long should an MVP last?**

**A:** I don't like thinking about timelines and roadmaps. For people in the pre-MVP stage, just launch something and figure it out. One characteristic of startups is that the path from A to Z is not clear. Focus on solving the problem right in front of you first.

**Q: How do you balance improving the MVP for retention versus focusing on acquisition?**

**A:** Both. A startup is a multi-variable problem. Don't try to reduce it to a single variable. As a founder, you're going to have to juggle multiple things.

**Q: How do you talk to users who don't want to discuss their problem?**

**A:** I question you starting a startup to help people if you don't know anyone with that problem who's willing to talk to you.

**Q: How many users do you need before presenting to investors?**

**A:** Wait for the lecture on when to talk to investors.

**Q: What traction indicates product validation?**

**A:** How do you know when you have product-market fit? If you're asking, you don't have it. When you have product-market fit, people start using your product so much that you transition to just trying to keep it online. You stop thinking about new features or improving funnels - you're just struggling to serve all the users coming to your product.

The horrible reality is that almost no one gets product-market fit. Almost no one. People often redefine it as "someone's using my product." That's not product-market fit. That's just having a user.

**Q: The more users we talk to, the bigger the problem becomes. Where do we start with our MVP?**

**A:** That's totally fine and expected. The mistake founders often make is thinking they have to solve the problem for all users. If you have one user with a set of problems, try to figure out if there are others like them. Ask, "Do you know anyone else with your exact same problem?"

Founders get screwed up with their MVP because they have a big vision and aren't willing to have a small MVP. They feel if they're not addressing all potential users upfront, they're failing.

There are many things a founder has to keep in mind simultaneously:
- Vision big, MVP small
- Grow and retain
- Investor pitch vs. customer pitch

How could it be true that we want to do payments for everyone, and have a little API that's so hard to use that we have to install it for people? Both things can be true, and you have to be comfortable with that contradiction.

**Q: In the pharmaceutical space, will my users be scientists or patients?**

**A:** That's a question for you. You're starting the company, you know what you're building, you know the problem you're solving, you know who has the problem. I don't know any of those things.
