00:01 All right.
00:01 So when I talk about making
products users love what I
00:05 mean specifically is like
how do we make things that
00:09 has a passionate user base
that our users
00:13 are unconditionally wanting
it to
00:17 be successful both on the
products that we build, but
00:20 also the companies behind
them.
00:22 We're gonna go over tons of
information.
00:26 Try not to take too many
notes,
00:27 mostly just try to listen.
00:28 I'll post the link to the
slides on my Twitter account
00:31 and on that link, there will
be a way for you to
00:33 annotate the slide and you
can ask me questions.
00:36 And so if we don't get to
them,
00:37 I'll answer them after the
talk.
00:39 So, you guys have been.
00:41 Listening to and
00:41 hearing a lot about growth
over the last several weeks,
00:45 and to me I feel like growth
is usually fairly simple.
00:48 It's the interaction between
two sort of concepts or
00:50 variables.
00:51 Conversion rate and churn.
00:54 Right?
00:55 And the gap between those
two things pretty
00:58 much indicate how fast
you're gonna grow.
01:01 And most people, especially
business type people,
01:04 tend to look at this
interaction in terms of
01:06 a very calculated in a
mathematical sort of way.
01:09 And today, I sort of want to
01:10 talk about these things at a
more human scale.
01:12 All right, cuz at start up
when you're interacting with
01:15 your users, you have a
fairly intimate
01:17 interaction that you have in
the early stages.
01:19 And so, I think there's a
different way of looking at
01:21 this stuff in terms of how
we build our products.
01:23 And we'll look at a lot of
different examples of that.
01:25 And how it's executed well.
01:28 My philosophy behind a lot
of things that I teach
01:31 startups is the best way to
sort of get to a billion
01:33 dollars is to focus on the
values that help you
01:36 get that first dollar, to
acquire that first user.
01:39 If you sort of get that
right everything else will
01:41 sort of take care of itself.
01:43 It's a sort of faith thing.
01:45 So I came to be a partner at
YC by way of being alumni.
01:50 I went to the program in
winter of 2006, so
01:52 it's the second ever program
and
01:54 I built a product called
Wufoo.
01:55 Wufoo's an online forum
builder.
01:57 It helps you create contact
forums and
01:59 online surveys and simple
payment forms.
02:01 It's basically a database
that looks like it's
02:03 designed by Fisher Price.
02:05 What's.
02:06 Interesting, though, is that
because it was fairly easy
02:09 to use, we're had customers
from every industry, market,
02:13 and vertical you can think
of, including a,
02:16 a majority of the Fortune
500 companies out there.
02:18 Ran the company for five
years, and
02:21 then we were acquired by
SurveyMonkey in 2013.
02:24 And at the time,
02:26 we were a very interesting
acquisition.
02:29 We were only a team of ten
people at the time.
02:30 And, while we acquired
funding out here in
02:33 Silicon Valley through Y
Combinator we actually ran
02:36 the company from Florida.
02:37 We had no office.
02:39 Everyone worked from home.
02:42 And we're an interesting
outlier.
02:44 So, each dot here represents
a start up that was,
02:48 that exited through IPO or
acquisition.
02:50 And we're this outlier to
the left.
02:52 The bottom is the funding
amount they took.
02:54 And the vertical axis is,
02:56 the valuation of the company
at the time.
02:57 To sum it up,
02:58 the average startup rates as
about $25 million.
03:02 And they return to their
investors about 676%.
03:05 Wufoo raised about $118
thousand total.
03:09 And our return to our
investors is about 29,000%.
03:13 &gt;&gt; So a lot of people were
very interested.
03:15 And are sort of like.
03:16 What makes.
03:16 Wufoo a little bit different
or
03:18 how do we run the company
very differently, and
03:20 a lot of it was focused on
product.
03:23 We weren't interested in
building software that,
03:25 I guess that just people
wanted to use.
03:29 Right.
That reminding you that you
03:30 worked in a cubicle,
03:31 cuz it was database app at
its sort of core.
03:34 We wanted a product that
people wanted to love.
03:37 That people wanted to have a
relationship with, and we
03:39 were actually very fanatical
about how we approached.
03:42 This idea.
03:44 At the point where it's
almost sort of
03:47 sort of sciency sort of way.
03:50 So what we said was like
Okay.
03:52 What's interesting about
start-ups in terms of
03:55 us wanting to create things
that people love is that,
03:59 love and unconditional sort
of feelings are things that
04:01 are difficult for us to do
in sort of real life.
04:04 And at start-ups we have to
do it sort of at scale.
04:07 So we've decided to do is
04:08 just start of by just
looking at, Okay,
04:10 how does real relationships
work in the real world, and
04:13 how can we apply them to
sort of how we
04:14 run our business and sort of
build our product that way.
04:18 So we'll go over basically
these two metaphors,
04:20 find new users as if we're
trying to date them and
04:22 existing users as if it were
a successful marriage.
04:26 So when it comes to dating,
lot of the stuff that
04:28 we uncovered had to do with
first impressions.
04:33 all, all of you often talk
about your relationships in
04:36 terms of the origin story.
04:37 If I asked you to tell me
about the first kiss,
04:39 how you sort of met, how you
proposed,
04:41 these are the things that we
say over and
04:43 over and over again.
04:43 They're basically the
word-of-mouth stories of our
04:46 relationships, and they're
the same kinds of
04:48 things that we do with
companies.
04:50 Human beings
04:51 are relationship
manufacturing creatures.
04:52 We cannot help, but create
and anthropomorphize
04:56 the things we interact with
over and over again.
04:60 So, whether it's the cars we
drive,
05:01 the clothes we wear, the
tools and software's we use,
05:04 we eventually prescribe
characteristics to it.
05:06 A personality.
05:07 And we expect it to behave a
certain way.
05:09 And that's how we sort of
interact with it.
05:11 Now first impressions are
important for
05:13 the starting of any
relationship,
05:15 because it's the one we tell
over and over again.
05:16 Right?
05:17 And there's something
special about how we
05:20 regard that origin story.
05:21 I'll give an example.
05:22 If you're on a first date
with somebody,
05:24 and you're having a nice
dinner, and
05:26 you catch them picking their
nose.
05:29 You are probably not gonna
have another date with them.
05:32 Right, but if you're married
to someone for
05:33 about 20 to 30 years,
05:34 and you catch on the Barca
Lounger digging for
05:38 gold right?
05:39 You don't immediately like
call your lawyer,
05:40 right, and then say like we
have a problem here.
05:43 I need to start drawing up
papers for divorce.
05:45 You shrug your shoulders and
05:47 say at least he has a heart
of gold.
05:50 So solving about.
05:51 First time interactions
means that the threshold is
05:55 so much lower in terms of
pass fail.
05:58 So, in software, and for
06:01 most products in internet
software that we use, like,
06:03 first impressions are pretty
obvious.
06:05 And they're the things that
you see a lot of
06:06 companies sort of pay
attention to in terms of
06:08 what they send their
marketing people to work on.
06:10 My argument for people who
are very good at product is
06:14 they discover so many other
first moments, and
06:16 they make those something
memorable.
06:19 Right, the first email you
ever get from a piece of
06:21 software.
06:22 What happens when you first
log in?
06:24 The links, the advertising,
the very first time you
06:26 interact with customer
support.
06:28 All of those are
opportunities to seduce.
06:32 So how did we think about.
06:34 Sort of like making first
moments on there,
06:36 and we actually took this
concept from the Japanese.
06:39 They actually have two words
for
06:41 how to describe things when
you're finished with them
06:43 in terms of saying like is
this a quality item.
06:46 And the two words of quality
are atarimae hinshitsu and
06:47 miryokuteki hinshitsu.
06:48 And the first one means,
taken for
06:51 granted quality, basically
functionality.
06:53 And the last one sort of
means,
06:55 enchanting quality, right?
06:58 Take for example a pen,
right?
06:60 Something has miryokuteki,
right, if the weight of
07:04 the pen, the way the ink
flows out of it, the way
07:06 it's viewed by the people
reading the handwriting from
07:09 the pen is pleasurable both
to the user of the pen and
07:12 the people who experience
the byproducts of it,
07:15 right, taking it to the sort
of next level.
07:19 Start with some examples.
07:20 So this is Wufoo's Login
link, and
07:23 it has a dinosaur on it,
which I think is awesome.
07:26 But if you hover over it,
07:29 the spec has the added
benefit of having a tool tip
07:32 that doesn't explain like
how to login or
07:34 what it does, but basically,
rawr.
07:36 And.
07:38 What we noticed about this,
like in early usability
07:40 studies as like this put a
smile on people's faces.
07:42 Like, hands down.
07:44 Right?
07:44 Universally.
07:45 And I think a lot of times
when we
07:47 are assessing products, we
never think about,
07:49 like, hey what is the
emotion on
07:50 the person's face when they
interact with this?
07:54 This is Vimeo's log in page
this is
07:56 actually a couple integr,
iterations ago.
07:57 It's one I find to be the
most beautiful, but.
08:01 It lets you know that when
you're starting out on
08:02 this journey with Vimeo,
08:03 that this is gonna be
something different.
08:06 They do this all over the
app.
08:07 If you search for the word
fart, as you scroll up and
08:10 down it makes fart noises as
you do this.
08:12 Right?
08:13 There's something different,
08:14 like this site interacts
with you.
08:16 &gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; It's a little bit
08:16 magical, it's a little bit
different.
08:18 And it's something that you
wanna talk about.
08:21 You don't have to always do
it with design.
08:24 This is a sign up form for
08:25 Cork which used to be a
social network for
08:26 people who loved to drink
wine.
08:29 On it, it says email
address,
08:31 it's also your sign-in and
has to be legit.
08:33 First name, what your mom
calls you, last name,
08:36 what your Army buddies call
you.
08:37 Password, something you'll
remember, but hard to guess,
08:40 password confirmation, think
it a, type it again.
08:42 Think of it as a test.
08:44 It's literally a poem as you
fill out the form.
08:47 Right?
08:48 And this is a kind of like
thing where you like,
08:51 oh, I like the people behind
this.
08:52 I, I, I'm gonna enjoy this
experience.
08:54 Now what does it say when
you fill out form like this?
08:56 Right.
08:56 On Yahoo, about what the
personality.
08:59 Of the site it's gonna be.
08:60 And what's disappointing to
me is like,
09:03 Yahoo forces every product
and
09:05 service under them to use
this exact same login form.
09:08 Flickr, I had thought,
09:09 had one of the best sort of
call to actions.
09:11 It was, get in there.
09:14 Right?
09:16 This is Heroku's.
09:19 Sign up page.
09:20 I think this is an older
version.
09:21 But, what's remarkable about
it is that, what you
09:24 start getting a feel for is
like, oh, scaling up.
09:28 My sort of server, and
09:29 back end services is as easy
as sort of dragging up and
09:33 down, different sort of nobs
and levers.
09:36 It's gonna be beautifully
used, and
09:38 it looks fairly easy to
scale.
09:41 Since we're in a room full
of computer science people,
09:45 I think you'll appreciate
this.
09:47 This is Chocolat.
09:48 This is a code editor, and
09:50 they only have one call to
action.
09:51 When the time limit is up,
they say, everything in
09:55 terms of all the pieces are
exactly the same except we
09:58 change the font.
09:60 To comic sans.
10:03 And what they're basically
saying is like hey
10:07 we know who our users are,
who our real customers are.
10:10 They're gonna be the people
who care about this.
10:15 This is Hurl, this is a
website for
10:17 checking htp requests, and
sometimes the places where
10:23 you get errors are
opportunities for
10:25 first moments,
10:27 you had a four of four this
is what you get it,
10:29 when we need help oftentimes
what we do is where we
10:32 create like really beautiful
mark, marketing materials.
10:40 But when you actually need,
like, documentation we sort
10:43 of like skimp out on sort of
design features.
10:46 And this is a point that,
like,
10:48 you see happen over and over
again.
10:50 A company that gets this
right is MailChimp.
10:52 And what they did was they
redesigned all of their
10:53 help guides so that they
looked like magazine covers.
10:56 And overnight, basically,
10:58 readership goes up on all
these features.
10:60 And customer support for
these things that sort of
11:02 help people optimize emails
goes down.
11:06 Speaking of documentation,
stripe.
11:10 What's interesting about an
API company is that there is
11:14 no UX.
11:14 The UX is actually just
documentation, right?
11:17 And there's opportunities
even in documentation.
11:19 Sort of the enchant and
amaze.
11:21 So one of the things that I
11:22 love about them is their
examples are wonderful.
11:24 But if you're actually,
like,
11:25 sort of logging into the
app,
11:27 one of the things that is a
super pain for most people,
11:29 when you're dealing with
most people's APIs, is,
11:31 like, grabbing your API
credentials and keys.
11:34 And what Stripe does is it
says oh,
11:36 if you're logged into the
app.
11:37 We automatically put
11:37 your API credentials into
the examples, so you only
11:40 have to copy paste once when
trying to learn their API.
11:48 When Wufoo wanted to launch
the third version of our API
11:50 we realized like, Okay, that
finally this is good enough
11:52 that we want people to sort
of build on top of it.
11:54 We were trying to figure
out,
11:55 like, how do we launch this
out to the world,
11:57 that sort of has our
personality behind it.
11:59 Because a lot of people,
11:59 they usually do things like
a programming API contest,
12:02 and they give out iPads and
iPhones.
12:04 And it makes you look like
everyone else.
12:06 And so, in our company one
weird value to
12:09 have it's a quirk of us,
12:11 is that the co-founders are
big medieval nuts.
12:14 And we take everyone out to
Medieval Times every single
12:17 year, on the anniversary of
the founding of the company.
12:19 And so, we said we have to
do something in that flavor.
12:22 And so we contacted the guys
at armor.com,
12:24 we said can you forward us a
custom battle-ax.
12:27 And what we said was if
12:28 you win our programming
contest you would win one.
12:33 The result is like people
wanted to talk about this.
12:36 It's something that people
wanted to work on cuz
12:37 they wanted to be able to
say it like I'm programming.
12:40 For a weapon.
12:43 And what's cool is we had
over 25 different
12:47 applications created for us
of quality and quantity that
12:51 we could not have paid for
on the budget and
12:53 the sort of time that we had
for this.
12:55 We got things like an iPhone
app and
12:56 Android and WordPress
plugins, right?
12:59 And all because what we did
was we changed how
13:01 people wanna talk about the
origin story of
13:03 how they're interacting with
one of our services.
13:06 And go like all day long of
going over these examples.
13:09 But I'm gonna short cut this
by saying,
13:11 you should just subscribe a
little bit of details.
13:13 It's just basically tons of
screen shots of software
13:16 that's just doing it right.
13:17 That shows that they're
being
13:18 conscientious of the user
and the customers.
13:28 When it comes to long term
relationships or
13:31 marriages, the only research
that we ended up having to
13:34 read was the stuff that was
done by John Gottman.
13:37 He's been featured in This
American Life,
13:40 in Malcolm Gladwell's books.
13:41 He's a marriage researcher
up in Seattle.
13:43 And he has an interesting
parlor trick that he can do.
13:45 He can watch a video tape of
a couple fighting about some
13:49 issue for 15 minutes.
13:50 And predict with an 85%
accuracy rate whether that
13:53 couple will be together or
13:54 not, or divorced in four
years.
13:57 If he increases that video
up to an hour.
13:59 And asks them to also talk
about their hopes and
14:01 dreams.
14:02 That prediction rating goes
up to 94%.
14:03 They showed these same video
tapes to marriage
14:06 counselors, successfully
married couples,
14:08 sociologists, psychiatrists,
priests, et cetera and
14:12 they can't predict with
random chance whether people
14:15 are gonna be together or
not.
14:16 So John Gauntman understands
something fundamental about.
14:20 How relationships work in
the long term.
14:22 And that basically how we
fight, even in a short term
14:26 period can indicate sort of
the whole system and
14:29 what it's gonna look like.
14:30 And one of the surprising
things he discovered,
14:32 it's not that
14:32 successfully married people
don't fight at all.
14:34 It turns out everybody
fights.
14:36 And we all fight about the
exact same things money,
14:39 kids, sex, time and others.
14:41 And others are things like
jealousy and in-laws.
14:45 To bring this around, right,
you can actually attribute
14:48 every single one of these to
problems that you see in
14:50 customer support when you're
building out your products.
14:53 Right, so.
14:57 This costs too much.
14:58 I'm having problems with a
credit card.
15:00 If you're building a service
that helps people deal with
15:02 their clients they're very
15:03 sensitive about anything
happening with that.
15:05 Performance.
15:07 How long you're up and how
fast.
15:11 Others are I said jealousy
and in-laws.
15:14 Right, so that's competition
and partnerships.
15:16 So anything weird happening
there,
15:17 people are gonna write to
you about.
15:19 And the reason I like to
think about this in
15:21 terms of customer support is
that in every ones that
15:23 are processing of like a
conversion funnel,
15:26 customer support is the
thing that happens in
15:28 between every one of these
steps.
15:29 It's the reason why people
don't make it
15:31 further down there.
15:32 It's the thing that prevents
conversion from happening.
15:35 Now, as we were thinking
through all these ideas and
15:38 as we were building up the
company,
15:40 we realized that there's a
big problem about how
15:42 everyone sort of starts
their company or
15:44 build up their sort of
engineering teams.
15:46 And that is that there's a
broken feedback loop there.
15:49 People are divorced from the
consequences of
15:51 their actions.
15:52 And this is the result of
actually the natural
15:54 evolution of how most
companies get founded,
15:56 especially by technical
co-founders, right.
15:58 Before launch it is a time
of bliss, nirvana, and
16:02 opportunity, right?
16:03 Nothing that you do is
wrong, right?
16:07 By your hand, which you feel
is like god, everything that
16:10 you write, every line of
code feels perfect, right,
16:13 and is ingenious to you.
16:15 The thing that happens is
after launch reality sort of
16:18 sets in and then all these
other tasks sort of
16:20 come into place that we have
to deal with.
16:23 Now what technical
co-founders wanna do is get
16:26 back to that initial state
and so what we often do,
16:29 and what we often see is
that companies start
16:31 siloing off all these other
things that actually is
16:34 what makes a start up or a
company sort of real, right?
16:37 And have other people do
them.
16:40 To, in our minds, these
other tasks are inferior.
16:43 Right?
And we have other people in
16:44 the company do them.
16:46 And so for us, what we're
trying to figure out
16:48 is how do we change software
development so that we
16:50 inject some values that we
don't talk about enough?
16:54 Responsibility,
accountability,
16:56 humility, modesty.
16:58 Right, and we called this,
like a lot of other people,
17:01 we had an acronym, Support
Driven Development, and
17:06 it's very similar to TDD or
other agile practice.
17:10 It's a way of creating high
quality software, but
17:13 it's super simple.
17:14 You don't need like, a
SCRUM,
17:15 you don't need a bunch of
post-it notes, all you
17:18 have to do is make everyone
do customer support.
17:22 And what you end up having
is
17:23 you fix the feedback loop,
right?
17:24 The people who build the
software are the ones
17:25 supporting it and
17:26 you get all these sort of
nice benefits as a result.
17:30 So one of them is, support
responsible developers and
17:33 designers and people who
build the stuff,
17:35 they give the very best
support.
17:37 Now we're not the first
person to think of this.
17:39 Paul English was a big
proporter of this at Kayak,
17:41 and what he did was install
a red customer support phone
17:45 line in the middle of the
engineering floor.
17:47 And they were just regular
customer support calls.
17:50 And people would ask him
often times,
17:54 why would you pay engineers
$120,000 or
17:56 more to do something that
you can pay other people
17:59 a fraction of to handle in
like a call center?
18:03 And he says, well, after the
second or
18:05 third time that phone rings
and the engineer gets
18:07 the same problem they stop
what they're doing, they fix
18:10 the bug, and we stop getting
phone calls about it.
18:14 It, it's a way of having Q-A
in a sort of
18:17 nice elegant solution.
18:20 Now, John Gotman talks about
the reason that we often
18:24 break up with one another as
due to four major causes and
18:27 their warning signs.
18:27 He calls them the four
horsemen, right?
18:29 Criticism, contempt,
defensiveness,
18:33 and stonewalling.
18:34 Now, criticism is basically
people starting to focus,
18:39 not just on the specific
issue at hand, but
18:40 on the overarching issues.
18:41 Like, you never, right,
listen to your users or
18:46 you never think about us all
the time.
18:48 Right?
18:50 Contempt is when someone is
purposely trying to
18:54 insult somebody.
18:55 Defensiveness is not trying
to take accountability
18:60 trying to make excuses for
the actions.
19:02 And stonewalling is
basically shutting down.
19:04 Stonewalling, to John
Gotman, is, is one of
19:07 the worst things that we can
do in a relationship.
19:09 Hold up.
19:15 And oftentimes, you know, we
don't worry much about this
19:18 in customer se, criticism
and contempt.
19:20 Right?
Defensiveness,
19:21 you see this all the time,
all the times in companies,
19:23 especially as they get
older.
19:24 But stonewalling, this is
something I
19:25 see happen with start-ups
all the time.
19:29 You get a bunch of customer
support sort of
19:30 coming in and you just think
I don't need to answer it.
19:32 I don't need to respond.
19:33 Right?
And
19:34 that act of just not even
getting back to
19:36 them is one of the worst
things you can do.
19:38 And it's probably some of
the biggest causes of
19:40 churn in the early stages of
start-ups.
19:44 This is how support worked
out with Wufoo.
19:45 When we were acquired we had
about 500,000 users on
19:48 the system, 5 million people
used Wufoo forms and
19:51 reports, whether they knew
it or not, and
19:53 all those people got support
from the same ten people,
19:56 and usually it was
19:57 only one person dedicated
support a day, or any shift.
20:00 Results in about 400 issues
a week.
20:02 That's about 800 emails.
20:04 But a response time from 9
a.m.
20:06 to 9 p.m.
was
20:06 between seven to 12 minutes.
20:08 Right?
And from 9 p.m.
20:09 to midnight it was an hour.
20:11 And on the weekend it would
be no longer than 24 hours.
20:13 And we carried this up all
the way up to the scale.
20:18 What a lot of people forget
about, and
20:20 often talk about with
Airbnb, is how, like oh,
20:23 they did this interesting
thing where they had,
20:25 went up to New York and
offered, like,
20:27 professional photographers,
and the founders would go
20:28 out there and actually take
pictures of
20:30 the people's apartments to
help them sell more.
20:32 Focusing on the stories
around conversion.
20:34 What most people don't
realize is a lot of
20:36 times when I saw Joe in the
early days of Airbnb,
20:39 he had a phone, sort of head
set stuck to his head all
20:41 the time, because he was
doing phone support nonstop.
20:46 Churn is a story we don't
like to talk about often,
20:48 all the time.
20:49 Airbnb's sort of growth
really started picking up
20:53 once they figured out
20:53 how to match capacity to the
demand, or the phone
20:56 calls that they were getting
into their support system.
21:01 At Wufoo we actually
constantly did experiments
21:03 around support, because
we're so obsessed with it.
21:06 One experiment we did was,
we heard Kathy Sierra
21:09 do a talk about there's a
disconnect between the
21:11 motions that we have when we
need help, and sort of.
21:15 The content and the
reactions we get from
21:17 people when we get help from
them, especially online.
21:18 Because they just don't see
all those nonverbal cues.
21:23 So she said unless there's
face recognition on the web,
21:25 we're just always going to
be
21:26 disconnected from our users.
21:28 Our feeling was,
21:29 like, well we're not face
recognition experts but
21:31 I think there's another way
of getting empathy.
21:33 So, as form builders, we
added a drop-down and
21:36 what we said was like, hey,
what's your emotional state?
21:40 And our hypothesis was
21:41 that no one was gonna fill
this out.
21:42 We basically thought, oh
okay, you know what the,
21:46 this is gonna be pretty a
lame experiment, but
21:49 we'll see how it sort of
goes.
21:50 And it turned out the
Emotional State
21:51 drop-down field was filled
out 75.8% of the time.
21:55 The browser type drop-down
filled just in
21:57 comparison was filled out
78.1% of the time.
22:00 All right?
22:01 So people were basically
telling us, for
22:03 my technical support issue
how I feel about this
22:07 problem is just as important
as, like, all the technical
22:10 details you need to sorta
figure out how to debug it.
22:14 Now we didn't prioritize
things or
22:17 triage things by emotion,
right, and for
22:18 the most part, people didn't
game the system.
22:20 One of the interesting
byproducts of it was that we
22:23 noticed that people started
being nicer to
22:24 us in the customer support.
22:26 It was something sort of
subconscious.
22:27 We just were thinking like,
wow,
22:29 users are so much better
now.
22:30 What's going on?
22:31 And we went back and looked
at the data and
22:34 we did some text analysis
and we realized is that, oh,
22:37 when it comes to only
communicating with
22:40 people over written words,
like email, there's
22:44 only three ways that you
show strong emotions, right?
22:46 Exclamation marks curse
words, and all caps.
22:50 And sure enough on all three
of those metrics,
22:52 they've gone down.
22:53 In sort of the way people
were talking to us in
22:55 the customer support.
22:56 Once people had a simple
outlet for their emotions,
22:59 right, people would be a lot
more rational,
23:00 and it made our jobs a lot
more pleasant as a result.
23:03 The other byproduct that is
awesome is that
23:09 you actually build better
software when you do this.
23:11 Far better software.
23:12 This is actually backed up
by tons of research.
23:14 Jared Spool, a user
interface engineer, which is
23:16 sort of the big players in
this space says like,
23:19 there's a direct correlation
to how much time we
23:21 spend directly exposed to
users and
23:25 how good our designs sort of
get.
23:27 He says it has to come in
this specific way.
23:29 It has to be direct
exposure, right?
23:31 It can't be something where
23:32 someone generates a report
or through a graph, you
23:34 have to be interacting with
them somewhat real time.
23:37 It has to be a minimum of
every six weeks.
23:39 And it has to be for at
least two hours.
23:41 Otherwise your software will
get worse over time.
23:46 Our developers, our people
who are on,
23:48 on Wufoo were getting
exposed to our users four to
23:51 eight hours every single
week.
23:54 And what it does is it
changes the way you sort of
23:57 build software.
23:57 Jared Spool has another way
of talking about how
24:00 we build products.
24:01 Right?
24:03 Let's imagine that this
represents all the knowledge
24:07 needed to sort of use your
app on a spectrum.
24:10 Right?
This is like no knowledge.
24:12 Right?
And this is
24:12 all the knowledge needed.
24:14 Right?
And
24:14 these two lines are pretty
much your interactions with
24:16 users what you're trying to
get them to.
24:18 This is currently where
their knowledge point is and
24:20 this is the target knowledge
point that you're trying to
24:22 get them to, to understand
that to use your app.
24:25 The gap between those is
called the knowledge gap,
24:27 Jared Spool called it, Spool
calls.
24:28 And what's interesting about
this is there's only two
24:32 ways, right, to sort of fix
this.
24:34 That gap represents how
intuitive your
24:36 app is, right?
24:38 You either get the user to
increase their
24:41 knowledge or you decrease
the amount of knowledge
24:44 that's needed to use your
application.
24:46 And oftentimes, as engineers
and people who build and
24:48 work on products, we think
let's add new features.
24:52 And new features only
24:53 means let's increase the
knowledge gap.
24:58 So for us we actually
focused a lot on
25:00 the other sort of direction.
25:02 And so what that meant we
spent a lot of time,
25:04 30% of our engineering time
was spent on internal tools
25:07 to help with our customer
support stuff.
25:09 But oftentimes it
25:10 was spent helping people
help themselves.
25:13 Things like frequently asked
questions, tool tips.
25:16 Things like, if you just
click the help link,
25:18 right, instead of taking you
to the generic help sort of
25:21 documentation page,
25:21 you go to the specific page
where you're looking at
25:24 is going to be most, sort
of,
25:26 appropriate for what you're
working on.
25:28 We redesigned our
documentation over and
25:30 over again, AB tested it
constantly.
25:32 One iteration of our
documentation reduced
25:34 customer support by 30% over
night.
25:37 It's one of those things
where,
25:38 like, overnight, all the
people that work on
25:41 the product immediately had
30% less work to do.
25:47 Now what happens if you have
everyone work on
25:48 customer support constantly,
and
25:50 thinking about it in terms
of a remarkable way?
25:52 Well, I talked a lot about,
25:53 in the very beginning growth
is a function of
25:56 conversion and churn.
25:58 This is Wufoo's growth curve
for the first five years.
26:01 Right?
26:02 What's interesting is that
we
26:03 paid no money on
advertising, on marketing.
26:08 All of it was done by word
of mouth growth.
26:11 Right?
26:12 And the interaction between,
like,
26:13 new users and downgrades are
this.
26:19 It's so slight what it
takes, that gap,
26:21 making that sort of work.
26:22 And what a lot of people
keep forgetting is that
26:25 there's almost no difference
between an increase in
26:27 conversion rate, 1% increase
and a 1% decrease churn.
26:30 They do exactly the same
thing to your growth.
26:33 However, the ladder is
actually much easier to do.
26:36 It's much cheaper to do, in
your apps, and
26:38 a lot of the times we
neglect this,
26:40 neglect this to way far
along.
26:42 Right?
And we usually have our
26:43 B team works on these sort
of projects and services.
26:46 This is actually not the
graph that we track most of
26:48 the time at Wufoo, it's not
even the one I'm proud of.
26:49 This is the one I'm proud
of.
26:52 Cuz even though we have this
sort of nice, awesome curve
26:55 of growth, this is what, how
loud is this scale?
26:58 Keep the company small, have
an awesome culture.
27:02 And that required doing a
lot of
27:03 these things to help people
sort of do what they need.
27:09 So John Gotman noticed there
was a different type of
27:14 behavior for relationships
and why people divorced.
27:19 Basically there would be
some subset of people who
27:22 would stay together 10, 15
years and
27:24 then all of a sudden they
divorce and
27:27 there was none of the other
indicators which sort of
27:30 show that this is what was
gonna happen.
27:32 And I was looking through
the data and
27:34 I realized oh, there's no
passion,
27:36 there's no fire between
these people, right?
27:38 When it comes to
relationships they
27:40 kinda follow the second law
of thermodynamics, right?
27:42 In a closed energy system
things tend to run down so
27:45 you have to constantly be
putting energy and
27:47 effort back into it.
27:48 Now the way a lot of people
sort of think about showing
27:50 people that I care about you
in products and in companies
27:54 is to do things like let's
have a blog, right?
27:57 Lets' have a newsletter?
27:59 The thing is, we look at
these rates and basically it
28:02 was such a small percentage
of our active users that it
28:04 was like, most of our users
have no idea all
28:06 the awesome stuff that we're
doing for them.
28:09 So we built a new tool.
28:10 We called it the Wufoo
system, and
28:12 what it allowed us to do was
just time stamp every new
28:14 feature that we're building
for users and
28:16 then every time they would
log in, we would look at
28:18 the difference between their
log in time or last log in
28:21 time and the new features
that were implemented.
28:23 And when you had this
message show up,
28:24 hey since you've been gone
28:25 here's all the awesome stuff
that Wufoo did for you.
28:28 Hands down this was the most
talked about feature I've
28:30 ever had every time I went
out to talk to users.
28:33 Right they'd say like dude I
love that since you've be,
28:35 since you've gone thing even
though I pay the same amount
28:37 every single month you guys
are doing something for
28:40 me almost every week and
it's totally awesome and
28:42 makes me feel, I'm getting
maximum value.
28:47 The other thing that we did
in
28:48 addition to having everyone
support the people that
28:50 paid their pay check is have
them say thank you.
28:53 And this was a large part
due to us injecting sort of
28:57 humility and modesty in to
sort of the equation.
29:01 Every single Friday we would
get together and
29:03 we'd just write simple hand
written thank you cards to
29:05 our users.
29:07 And I know there's tons of
people who would not be sort
29:11 of excited about doing this,
but it was a ritual that
29:14 made sort of all the
difference in terms of,
29:16 like, having a team that was
very tightly neat,
29:20 tightly knit, also.
29:21 And working on stuff that
they really cared about.
29:23 They always constantly knew
what the mission was for,
29:26 and why we sort of did what
we did.
29:28 These aren't fancy thank you
cards, right?
29:30 They're just simple,
29:31 like handwritten stuff on an
index card.
29:33 We threw in a sticker, and
29:34 slapped on a dinosaur on the
front of it.
29:37 And, what's interesting is
we started this practice as
29:42 a result of the early days
of starting Wufoo.
29:46 Chris, Ron, and I were
talking, and we're trying to
29:48 figure out, what are we
gonna do to sort of show
29:50 users that we appreciate
them around Christmas.
29:52 And he, Chris came up with
this idea where he said
29:55 hey guys, so a couple years
ago my mom, like, made me
29:59 write thank you notes to all
of my relatives.
30:02 For my Christmas gifts.
30:04 And I didn't really like to
do it but
30:05 the following year all my
presents were super good.
30:08 So, I think we should try
this for our business and
30:12 see how it goes.
30:14 So, that first year we wrote
handwritten Christmas cards
30:17 to all of our users that
first year.
30:20 Second year rolls around,
and
30:21 we have too many customers,
like, and
30:23 it's still just the three
founders.
30:25 And we were going like we're
kinda screwed,
30:27 I don't know what we're
gonna do.
30:29 And we read a book called
the ultimate question, and
30:31 in it he talks about hey,
30:33 just focus on your most
profitable users.
30:35 And just tend them and
30:37 take care of them, then
it'll work out.
30:38 So we're like, all right,
30:39 that, that makes sense,
that's scalable.
30:41 So that year we
30:42 only write to our highest
paying customers.
30:44 And the January rolls around
that second year and
30:48 one of our long time loyal
users writes us and
30:51 he's basically like, hey
guys I, I really loved
30:56 that Christmas card you sent
me the first year and I just
30:58 wanted you to know I haven't
received my second card yet
31:01 and I'm just looking forward
to it.
31:03 I know you didn't forget
about me.
31:06 Thanks a lot.
31:07 So we're like, fuck, because
the best way to sort of
31:12 exceed expectations is not
to send any to begin with,
31:14 so we were like sort of in
this conundrum.
31:16 And what we decided, after
thinking about it for
31:18 a while, is that we need to
stop doing it,
31:20 you know, just one time a
year.
31:22 It needs to be something
that's part of the culture.
31:24 Happens every, every, every
sort of week, even.
31:26 And even though we'll never
catch up to all of
31:28 our customers.
31:29 Just the practice of
31:30 doing it will make all the
difference.
31:33 I talked a lot
31:34 about a bunch of like
lovey-dovey stuff and
31:37 sort of like touchy-feely
things that I think a lot of
31:39 engineers don't like to
think about too often.
31:41 And so I'll end on some sort
of hard business
31:46 data or research.
31:47 There's an article that was
put out by
31:49 the Harvard Business Review
several years ago by
31:51 Michael Treacy and Fred
Wiersema and in it they
31:53 talk about the discipline of
market leaders.
31:56 They say there's only three
ways that you
31:57 achieve market dominance and
depending on how you want to
32:02 achieve that market
dominance you have
32:03 to organize your company in
a very specific way.
32:06 Best price, best product and
best overall solution.
32:09 If you want to be
32:10 the best price out there you
focus on logistics.
32:12 A Wal-Mart, an Amazon.
32:14 If you want to be the best
product out there you
32:15 focus on R&amp;D.
32:17 Apple's usually
32:17 a quintessential example of
that.
32:19 Best overall solution is
about
32:21 being customer intimate.
32:22 And this is the path that
you see followed by
32:23 luxury brands and
hospitality industry.
32:27 What I love about this path
towards market dominance is
32:30 that the third one is the
only one that
32:35 everyone can do at any stage
of their company.
32:38 Requires almost no money to
get started with.
32:40 Usually just co.
32:42 Requires a little bit of
humility and some manners.
32:45 And as a result you can
achieve the success as any
32:49 other people in sort of your
market.
32:52 That's all I got.
32:54 Thank you very much.
33:00 Yeah, let's take some
questions if you guys
33:03 have any.
33:04 Right in the back there.
33:05 &gt;&gt; Building products that
users love?
33:07 You might have multiple
different types of users.
33:10 How do you build one product
that all users love?
33:14 Maybe there is a feature
that one really likes but
33:16 detracts value from one
that.
33:18 &gt;&gt; All right.
So what do you do
33:19 when you have a product with
lots of
33:21 different type of users,
right?
33:22 Some users will love one
thing and
33:23 another will, will another.
33:25 And I agree, there's
33:26 a interesting fine line for
that.
33:27 What I always, usually tell
people,
33:29 is focus on the people who
are the most passionate,
33:31 especially in the early
stages.
33:32 Right?
Whoever's, whatever niche
33:34 it's gonna be, that's who I
focus on completely.
33:37 Things that a lot of
different projects did.
33:39 I think Ben Silverman of
33:40 Pinterest started off with a
designer bloggers, right?
33:43 Curtail your thing for
33:44 them and eventually you'll
figure out sort of universal
33:47 values that will appeal to a
lot of other people.
33:49 So, just start one at a
time.
33:51 And.
33:52 The, a lot of the examples
that you see up there,
33:54 a lot of people make the
mistake is like, oh,
33:55 I'll just make my app funny.
33:57 But, humor is like really
difficult to do.
34:00 Right?
What you wanna shoot for
34:01 is something sort of witty.
34:02 And, quite honestly,
34:04 you have to get
functionality right.
34:06 So like the Japanese
quality.
34:07 If you don't have a on
there, right, don't try to
34:10 do anything witty, right,
cuz it will backfire on you.
34:13 So hands down, our number
one focus is make it as
34:16 easy to use as possible for
and
34:18 anything else on top was
polish.
34:20 Right here.
34:21 &gt;&gt; So so everybody says that
to focus on your product.
34:28 I'm also good at that.
34:29 I love to do a project and I
love to make it the best.
34:32 But we are to that certain
point that we are focused on
34:35 our product but we don't get
like constantly right?
34:38 Sorry.
34:38 So second thing so how much
we should focus on product?
34:42 But because we should do now
marketing.
34:44 We should get somebody
customers and
34:45 like and like start talking
to customers but
34:48 when you are too focused on
your product.
34:50 Like users online have them.
34:53 Right, so what exactly do
you guys mean when you
34:55 are saying like focus only
on your product and
34:58 give the best product?
34:59 &gt;&gt; Okay.
35:02 So the question sort of is
how do we balance this
35:05 sort of thing where we wanna
be obsessed with
35:08 working on product.
35:10 Yet.
But all the other skills,
35:12 and sort of tasks that are
needed by a company,
35:14 like marketing and branding
and
35:16 all that stuff, and how, how
we sort of balance that.
35:18 And the thing is, like, it
starts off as you juggling,
35:20 like, tons of things
constantly in the air.
35:23 The thing is, if you're
working on products, like,
35:24 you should also always have
this flip side as
35:27 when you're talking to
users.
35:28 Right?
And for
35:29 us inside of Wufoo, the way
we got people to talk to
35:31 users is they just did
customer support.
35:32 And they got to see
firsthand, right away.
35:35 Whether that feature sucked
or not,
35:36 and also impacted everyone
else in the company,
35:38 because everyone had a
customer support shift.
35:39 So you have this sort of
social incentive to sort of
35:42 make everything work.
35:43 And so, like I said, there
should be no point where
35:46 you're only focused on
product.
35:47 You should always have time
where you work on product,
35:49 and then you see sort of
what users say, say to you.
35:51 And you should always have
this virtual, like,
35:53 feedback loop on there.
35:54 So be careful when you don't
have that.
35:57 Usually what ends up
happening, if you're lucky.
35:59 In terms of marketing and
36:00 sales, like, usually my
feeling is like, you have to
36:03 spend money on marketing and
advertising, all this stuff.
36:05 It's usually a tax you pay
because you
36:07 haven't made your product
remarkable.
36:08 Right?
36:10 Word of mouth growth is the
easiest kind of growth, and
36:12 it's how a lot of the great
companies sort of grow.
36:14 So figure out how to wait,
how to like,
36:16 have a story that people
want to tell.
36:18 About your product.
36:19 Where they're the most
interesting person at
36:20 the dinner table, right?
36:22 And then that person is your
sales person, right?
36:24 That person is your sales
force for you.
36:25 Right here.
36:28 &gt;&gt; like, where do you find
crystal clear customer or
36:32 user need and the demand is
there is the right solution.
36:36 How do you communicate with
engineering and
36:38 designing team to make sure
that because sometimes
36:42 people in the team come up
with ideas, and but
36:44 still at the end of the day,
36:46 how can you make a decision
with where to go?
36:48 &gt;&gt; Oh, so how do you make a
decision on product?
36:52 And communicate that with
your sort of
36:53 engineering team when
there's like lots of
36:54 different directions to go?
36:57 My feeling is that.
37:01 So for us we just looked at
support.
37:03 It was really easy cuz
37:04 you often just saw what are
things that
37:06 people are having the most
amount of problems with?
37:08 Or people asking all the
time.
37:10 You cannot help but get
feature requests from
37:12 people no matter like
whatever opening or
37:14 orifice you have in your
product or app.
37:16 Like, people will like jam
feature requests in there.
37:18 So you're easily going to
37:19 know sort of what they sort
of what.
37:20 Your job as a product person
and
37:22 engineer is to not just do
what they say, because that
37:25 way, you'll just be a slave,
is to figure out,
37:27 sort of deeply, what are the
reasons why underlying those
37:31 things and sort of solve
that deep underlying reason.
37:33 The thing is that everyone
wants to
37:35 have a different way of.
37:36 To sort of go, then
ultimately it comes down to,
37:38 like, someone's gonna figure
something out.
37:40 But I also make the smallest
version of each little idea.
37:43 No longer than a week or two
weeks to build it out there.
37:46 And you can try them out and
37:47 see sort of what works and
don't work.
37:49 I think it's dangerous to
37:50 have multiple different
product directions that
37:52 requires lots of time to
sort of figure out.
37:55 Sam.
37:56 &gt;&gt; Related to that can you
tell the story of
37:58 how the king for a day thing
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
38:01 Okay.
So
38:04 so I don't like hackathons.
38:07 I think they sort of suck in
terms of ones done inside
38:10 of companies.
38:10 Because.
38:11 You spend like 48 hours
working on something really
38:14 hard that you're sort of
passionate about and
38:16 99% of them never make it to
production right, and
38:20 it's sort, sort of real like
super sad.
38:22 So for us we like flipped it
on it's head and
38:24 we came up with an idea that
we called king for
38:26 a day and it actually worked
over the weekend.
38:28 But how it worked is someone
randomly in the company got
38:32 drawn and they got to be the
king, and the king got to
38:35 tell everyone else what to
do on the product.
38:36 So everything that was
bothering them about Wufoo.
38:40 About the customer support
stuff, or
38:41 some feature they really
want to have built.
38:43 They've got the engineering
resources, the market
38:44 resources, the advertising
resources of everyone inside
38:47 of the company, to make it
sort of happen.
38:49 And of course, we'd work
with them to
38:50 figure out like what can be
actually done in 48 hours.
38:53 But we would do this one to
two times a year.
38:57 And it was like a huge hit
and
38:58 it was a boost to morale,
cuz what people most love.
39:00 It is like working on things
where it's like, oh,
39:03 I made a difference to the
app.
39:05 Right?
39:06 And so, for us, that's one
way that we would like
39:09 sort of divide time for like
product direction.
39:11 It's like some times the
people that work for
39:13 you, they have a strong
opinion about where it,
39:15 where it should go.
39:15 And it's a good way to sort
of democratize it
39:18 a little bit, by rotating it
around.
39:21 Yes.
39:22 &gt;&gt; You said you guys all
work from home.
39:24 Usually seems like a
nightmare.
39:25 In that office, how do you
make that work?
39:28 &gt;&gt; Okay, so we all work from
home.
39:29 So, I will tell you this.
39:30 We all still work within the
Tampa Bay area.
39:32 We would allow anybody to
39:33 work from any where but
usually.
39:35 As we tried to recruit
them,they sort of
39:36 meet our team, and they just
decide,
39:38 okay we just want to come
and move here anyway.
39:42 Remote working, is
especially tricky,
39:47 a lot of people like to
romanticize it,
39:48 especially people, who are
like employees.
39:50 But the thing is, An office
gives you a lot of, sort of,
39:54 benefits, right, and
efficiencies that you now
39:57 have to compensate for when
you remote working.
39:59 But remote working also has
these other sort of
40:01 efficiencies in place, for
example,
40:03 I don't have to worry about
my employees losing two
40:05 hours of their day to
commuting, for instance.
40:08 So the biggest thing that we
had to do for
40:09 remote working is to respect
people's time.
40:12 And so the way we had it set
up is we actually had
40:15 a four and a half day work
week at Wufoo.
40:16 Half day on Friday was for
all the meetings and stuff.
40:19 We said like no business
deal,
40:21 meetings, no talking with
other outside parties.
40:23 They all have to be done on
Friday, on that half day.
40:26 It couldn't be done in the
middle of the week.
40:27 And then also one day of
everyone was
40:29 already dedicated customer
support.
40:31 So everyone in our company
effectively only had
40:33 three days each week to
actually build or
40:35 work on whatever they were
doing.
40:37 But I actually firmly
believe that if you
40:38 have three solid days,
right, eight to ten hours,
40:41 where you are only working
on what you need to build,
40:43 you can get a ton of shit
done.
40:45 And so what we said was,
40:47 you have to respect
everyone's time during that
40:49 three day period, if they're
in that three day period.
40:51 And what we came up with is
a 15 minute rule and the way
40:53 it worked is you can have a
discussion like a chat or
40:57 a phone call or whatever
with someone but it could go
40:59 no longer than 15 minutes so
if you have some complicated
41:02 issue that you couldn't
figure out we'd say,
41:04 at 15 minutes you are to
immediately table that item.
41:07 Right and have us discuss it
on Friday and
41:10 you'd move on to the next
item on your list right,
41:13 the enhanced productivity.
41:15 More often than not I, I
would say 90% of the time
41:18 the item never got brought
up on Friday because usually
41:20 what would happen is people
would sleep on it and then
41:23 they'd just magically say
like, hey I found a solution
41:26 or like hey that's not a big
problem whatsoever.
41:29 Because most problems inside
of companies,
41:31 they don't need to be solved
in real time, or right away.
41:34 The only things are like
when the site is down, or
41:37 payments aren't working.
41:38 Right?
Everything outside of
41:39 that is basically kind of
luxury, so
41:43 focus on your primaries as
much as possible.
41:46 And, as a result,
41:46 our ten person team did far
more than many,
41:48 many other companies, as a
result.
41:51 But, it takes extra work to
make remote working happen.
41:55 We are an extremely
disciplined sort of team.
41:57 And I would have to say
41:60 there's almost not many YC
companies that actually have
42:03 been able to replicate sort
of what we do.
42:04 I think there's only two
other companies in YC that
42:06 sort of have the same sort
of discipline working style.
42:09 It takes more work in a very
different fashion.
42:12 Right?
42:12 An office allows you to be a
little bit lazier, right,
42:15 in terms of all these things
around productivity.
42:21 Okay.
Over here.
42:22 &gt;&gt; Right.
42:23 Just to go off that question
as the leader of the team
42:26 how did you manage to
instill a company culture
42:30 but and also the count,
42:31 accountability the employees
especially cuz.
42:34 Working space.
42:36 &gt;&gt; Okay, how do we, how do
we set up accountability for
42:39 employees?
42:39 As, as a manager.
42:40 Alright, so, at Wufoo we
were profitable nine months
42:44 after launch, so, we had
profit sharing, right?
42:47 And so, it makes pretty
simple and clear.
42:50 It, it would be a multiple
of whatever bonus pull that
42:53 we sort of had, and
42:54 the performance measures
would be based on sort of,
42:57 how they did in customer
support.
42:58 All right, on their duties
there, and sort of
42:60 what they said they were
wanting to accomplish or do.
43:03 I don't like process, and I
don't like lots of
43:05 tools to help get people to
be productive.
43:07 So the only thing that we
had for
43:09 helping people manage, like,
43:10 sort of their projects, is
to-do lists.
43:12 And that is, like, simple
text files that we
43:14 shared in our Dropbox
account.
43:15 Each person had their name
on it, and you got to
43:17 see every time somebody
updated their to-do list.
43:20 What we said is every single
night just
43:21 set everything that you did
that day.
43:23 Right?
And then on Friday,
43:24 we would just go over.
43:25 Okay, this is what you
43:26 said last week that you're
gonna do.
43:27 This is what you actually
got done, or
43:28 the sort of the problems at
hand.
43:29 And it's super simple,
right?
43:31 It creates this like nice
written trail for
43:34 how to sort of handle stuff,
right?
43:36 And I don't have to worry
about managing them, right?
43:38 They sorta set the tone for
43:39 how they want to be sort of
assessed.
43:42 And it makes it really
simple.
43:43 And for people who are
excellent at what they do.
43:45 Right?
It works very, very well.
43:47 And then when you actually
have problems,
43:49 it's very easy to fire
people.
43:51 I was fortunate that I
43:52 never had to fire anyone at
Wufoo, right?
43:54 But we were able to correct
a lot of
43:55 people's behavior very, very
quickly.
43:58 Cuz we just kinda look at
this, and
43:59 it's like look, this is your
pattern of behavior.
44:00 You finish a fraction of the
items on your list.
44:03 You do most of
44:03 the items at the last second
right before Friday.
44:06 That's a problem, you've
gotta manage your time
44:07 better and this is evidence
that you've provided to us.
44:10 All we have to do is sort of
describe it back to you and
44:12 because everyone in the
company sort of sees it,
44:14 right, there's social
pressure that's put
44:16 into place that helps make
it all sort of happen.
44:20 Right here.
44:21 &gt;&gt; How did you hire people
that, you know,
44:23 you felt would be able to
work with in this kind of
44:26 environment that's, that's
&gt;&gt; So,
44:28 how do you hire people that
can work, remotely?
44:32 And then sort of work in
this sort of fashion.
44:34 So, pretty easily,
44:36 you have them work on a side
project for you.
44:38 So you contract them out,
and
44:39 they have to work remotely.
44:41 As such, usually, the
projects I like to
44:43 have them work on is about a
month long, right?
44:45 I could do things much
faster for a week.
44:47 But usually get a good sense
of,
44:48 like, how well people sort
of manage themselves, and
44:50 work on things from a
project like that.
44:52 So that was always the first
assessment.
44:54 Like we never did anything
just by interviews.
44:57 The other thing we had to,
sort of, screen them for
44:60 is their ability to do
customer support.
45:01 Because not any,
45:02 every engineer sort of has
the empathy skills to
45:06 handle that stress.
45:08 So sometimes I would have
people write breakup letters
45:12 to me, right, in an
interview, just like hey,
45:14 pretend you have to break up
with me you have 15 minutes
45:17 to write in on there and you
can only write it by hand,
45:19 what are you gonna say?
45:22 And so you get a good sense
of sort of their writing
45:24 skills, because like 90% of
what you do in customer
45:26 support is tell them bad
news, like, oh, we don't
45:28 support that feature, sorry
that's not gonna work, or.
45:31 It's not gonna be available.
45:32 And so people have to have
sort of tacked at that.
45:34 &gt;&gt; How 'bout one more
question?
45:36 &gt;&gt; One question, right here
the glasses.
45:39 &gt;&gt; So, since Wiki has all
these like tricks and
45:40 experiments that have really
helped the company.
45:43 Do you INAUDIBLE] of ones
that didn't work out?
45:45 &gt;&gt; Have all these tricks and
45:46 experiments to help the
company,
45:47 are there any ones that
didn't work out?
45:50 All right, I'll talk about
one.
45:52 So one of the things that we
did early on to try to
45:55 motivate ourselves was try
to get,
45:59 like we understood this idea
of like crunch mode and
46:01 that it's really bad for
people.
46:03 Like if you're doing the
subscription business you
46:04 need people to last for the
long term, and
46:06 video games a lot of times
they like crunch people.
46:08 All, all the time.
46:10 For like a specific deadline
or
46:11 have multiple sprints every
two weeks and
46:13 you have to shoot up to this
deadline and
46:14 it's like exhausting.
46:15 And so, because, when it's
happening it's like you
46:17 might get an increase in
productivity but
46:19 the recovery period that you
need for people is
46:20 always greater, right, than
the productivity you gain.
46:24 And at a company where you
46:25 need everyone doing customer
support and
46:26 being on their game and
constantly put, pushed out
46:27 features you don't have time
for recovery.
46:30 So, we were thinking about,
okay, we want to build like,
46:33 a company vacation into how
Wufoo sort of works to
46:37 reward our users every
single year.
46:38 And we said okay,
46:39 if the vacation is sort of
built in there for
46:40 the recovery, we could have
one crunch period, right,
46:43 before that vacation set up.
46:44 And we'll just only do
customer support that will
46:46 just sort of scale with
people.
46:48 So.
46:49 The way we did the very
first crunch mode
46:55 is that it was just between
the three founders.
46:57 And we had each of us draw a
ten-item to-do list.
47:01 That would be fairly
aggressive.
47:02 And the first person to
47:03 get through seven of their
items would win.
47:06 And the the last person to
47:07 get through seven of their
items.
47:09 Would become what we called
trippage.
47:11 And trippage meant that you
carried other
47:13 person's luggage and got
people drinks when you're on
47:16 the company vacation.
47:18 So we did that and during
that period,
47:22 everyone was like pretty
excited about it and
47:23 motivated, and only the
winner got to
47:25 choose the next company
vacation the following year.
47:28 And then all the sudden Ryan
had basically poorly
47:31 estimated the items on his
list.
47:33 And he realized very quickly
I'm going to fucking lose.
47:36 And so he was just like I
give up.
47:39 And he just sort of stopped.
47:40 So crunch mode turned out to
be blah mode for
47:42 him because he knew he was
gonna lose and
47:44 became pretty demoralized.
47:46 So as a result of doing
that, we
47:47 decided not to do it in that
similar fashion anymore.
47:50 So, good idea that we like
to talk about.
47:53 But is one that we, we never
did again.
47:55 All right, guys.
47:56 Thanks a lot.
47:57 You can email me at kevin@
