## Startup Cash Management: A No-Nonsense Guide for Founders

Let’s break down the key lessons from Kirsty Nathu, CFO at Y Combinator, who’s seen thousands of startups succeed (and fail) based on how they handle cash. Whether you’re building the next unicorn or running a local coffee shop, these principles are your survival kit. I’ll walk you through the main points, sprinkle in real-life examples, and keep the technical terms so you can Notion-ize it for your founder grind.

### **1. Cash Is King: Why You Need to Obsess Over Your Numbers**

**The Big Idea:**  
Cash is the lifeblood of any business. Run out, and it’s game over—no matter how cool your product is. The wild part? Tons of startups don’t even realize they’re out of cash until it’s too late

**What Numbers Matter?**
- **Bank Balance:** How much cash you have right now.
- **Money In:** All revenue coming in.
- **Money Out:** All expenses going out.

You don’t need fancy software. Your online banking and a spreadsheet are enough to track these.

**Real-life Example:**  
Imagine you’re running a SaaS startup. You check your bank account and see $150,000. Last month you made $10,000 from customers but spent $25,000 on salaries, AWS, and pizza. Your “burn” (money out minus money in) is $15,000 per month.

### **2. Burn Rate & Runway: How Long Until You Run Out?**

**Burn Rate:**  
This is simply your expenses minus your revenue. In our example, that’s $25K - $10K = $15K/month.

**Runway:**  
How many months until you hit zero?  
$$
\text{Runway} = \frac{\text{Bank Balance}}{\text{Burn Rate}}
$$
So, $150,000 / $15,000 = 10 months of runway

**Why It Matters:**  
If you fudge these numbers to make yourself feel better (“Let’s pretend our burn is only $10K!”), you’re just lying to yourself. The cash will run out on the same day.

### **3. Growth Rate & Default Alive vs. Default Dead**

**Growth Rate:**  
How fast is your revenue growing?  
$$
\text{Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{Revenue}_{\text{Month 2}} - \text{Revenue}_{\text{Month 1}}}{\text{Revenue}_{\text{Month 1}}}
$$
If you made $10K in July and $12K in August, your growth rate is 20%.

**Default Alive:**  
If your expenses stay flat and your revenue keeps growing at the same rate, will you hit profitability before you run out of money? If yes, you’re “default alive.” If not, you’re “default dead” and need to change something fast

**Real-life Example:**  
You have $100K in the bank, need $150K to reach profitability, and your revenue isn’t growing fast enough. You’re default dead unless you either cut costs or boost revenue growth.

### **4. Don’t Underestimate Expenses (Especially Your Own Time)**

Startups often ignore the true cost of doing business, especially early on:
- Founders pay themselves little or nothing, making customer acquisition costs look artificially low.
- When you start hiring, remember: employees cost 25–50% more than just their salary (think benefits, equipment, office space)

**Real-life Example:**  
You hire an engineer for $100K/year. With benefits and taxes, the real cost is $125K–$150K/year. Hire three engineers, and you’re burning through cash way faster than you thought.

### **5. Don’t Outsource Responsibility for Your Numbers**

It’s fine to hire a bookkeeper, but the CEO/founders must understand the numbers. Bookkeepers don’t know your business like you do, and mistakes happen. If you don’t check the reports, you might miss a cash crisis until it’s too late

**Real-life Example:**  
A founder ignores the monthly financials because “the bookkeeper handles it.” Turns out, a big payment was missed, and now there’s not enough runway to raise more money or fix the business.

### **6. Hiring and Scaling: More People ≠ More Success**

- Every hire is an investment. Make sure you’re getting a return.
- The best metric: **revenue per employee**—not just headcount.
- Don’t scale up (hire lots of people or spend big) before you have **product market fit**. More employees won’t magically make customers love your product

**Real-life Example:**  
A startup hires five salespeople before proving anyone wants the product. Sales don’t increase, and now the burn rate is out of control.

### **7. Fundraising: Don’t Wait Until You’re Desperate**

- Always assume you won’t raise more money. Plan to reach profitability with what you have.
- If you wait until you have only 6 months of runway left, your leverage with investors tanks.
- Start thinking about raising when you have at least 12 months of runway left

**Real-life Example:**  
A founder waits until there’s barely any cash left before trying to raise. Investors sense desperation and either walk away or offer terrible terms.

### **Bonus: Q&A Nuggets**

- **When to hire a CFO?** Not until after Series A. Before that, founders + a bookkeeper + a CPA for taxes is enough.
- **Forecasts in Seed Decks?** Not necessary if you don’t have product market fit. Focus on vision and market size instead

## TL;DR Cheat Sheet

- Track your **bank balance**, **burn rate**, and **runway** weekly.
- Be brutally honest about your numbers.
- Understand the real cost of employees and customer acquisition.
- Don’t delegate financial responsibility—founders must know the numbers.
- Only scale when you’ve nailed product market fit.
- Plan for profitability; don’t assume you’ll always be able to raise more money.

**Real-life analogy:**  
Think of your startup like a road trip across the desert. Your cash is your fuel. If you don’t know how much you have, how fast you’re burning it, or how far until the next gas station (profitability), you’re probably going to get stranded. Don’t let that happen—check your dashboard, plan your stops, and don’t pick up more passengers than you can afford to carry.

**Keep the grind smart, not just hard.**
