## 🎯 Major Mistakes & Solutions

### 1️⃣ Not knowing the essential financial metrics

**3 critical numbers every founder must track:**

| **Metric**       | **Meaning**                   | **Data Source**        | **How to Calculate**       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Bank balance** | Cash remaining in the account | Bank statements        | Directly from bank records |
| **Money in**     | Revenue                       | Accounting system/bank | Total net revenue          |
| **Money out**    | Operating expenses            | Accounting system/bank | Total expenses             |

💡 **Important note:**

* No fancy software needed – just spreadsheets + bank statements.
* **Not knowing these 3 numbers = suicide for startups**, since you won’t be able to control cash flow.

**Key metrics to calculate from these 3 numbers:**

* **Burn (Cash burn):** Expenses – Revenue
  *Example:* \$25,000 spent – \$10,000 revenue → Burn = \$15,000/month.
* **Runway:** Bank balance / Average burn
  *Example:* \$150,000 / \$15,000 → Runway = 10 months.
* **Revenue growth rate:** (Month 2 revenue – Month 1 revenue) / Month 1 revenue
  *Example:* July: \$10k → August: \$12k → Growth = 20%.
* **Default Alive/Dead:** Will your current growth trajectory reach profitability before you run out of cash? Use Trevor Blackwell’s Default Alive Calculator (Y Combinator) for this.

### 2️⃣ Not tracking metrics regularly

* **Recommendation:** Check at least **weekly**, or **daily** if your runway is low.
* **Why:** Spot problems early, adjust strategies in time – waiting until the last minute is often too late.

---

### 3️⃣ Misjudging expenses

* **Employee costs:** It’s not just salary – you must include hidden costs like equipment, insurance, and office space, usually 25-50% extra on top of salary.
* **Customer acquisition cost (CAC):** Early customers are easier and cheaper to acquire; over time, **acquisition costs go up**.
  **Common mistake:** Assuming CAC will remain stable.
* **Founders undervaluing their own time:** Even if you pay yourself little or nothing early on, you should still account for your own time when estimating true costs.

---

### 4️⃣ Over-reliance on fundraising

* **Root cause:** Many founders think “investors will always write the next check.”
* **Solution:**

  * Always plan to reach profitability with existing funds.
  * Treat fundraising as a growth booster, not your core survival strategy.

---

### 5️⃣ Scaling prematurely before product-market fit (PMF)

* **Mistake:** Assuming “hiring more people → instant sales growth.”
* **Reality:** Without PMF, scaling just burns cash faster.
* **Solution:**

  * Keep costs minimal while iterating to find what customers truly want.
  * Only scale when customers are *begging* to buy your product.

---

### 6️⃣ No clear plan for fundraising & profitability

* **Principle:**

  * Always assume **you won’t be able to raise another round.**
  * Plan to reach profitability with current cash.
* **Best time to fundraise:** When you still have ≥12 months of runway, so you’re not forced to negotiate under pressure.

---

## ✅ Conclusion & Advice

Kirsty’s core message: **“Most startups die because they run out of money.”** To survive:

* Know your key financial numbers & monitor them regularly.
* Adjust costs and strategies based on real data.
* Don’t rely solely on fundraising.
* Achieve product-market fit before scaling.
* Start thinking about fundraising when you have ≥12 months runway.

**Key to success:** Know your finances, spend wisely, and build a sustainable growth plan.
