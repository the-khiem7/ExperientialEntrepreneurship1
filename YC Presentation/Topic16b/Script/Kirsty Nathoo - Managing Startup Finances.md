1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,500
morning everybody thank you for coming

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,990
in at 9 o'clock it's an early start

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,109
so as Kevin mentioned my name is Kirsty

4
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,110
Nathu and I'm the CFO here at Y

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,190
Combinator so I've actually helped now

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,590
2,000 companies almost as they've come

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,470
through Y Combinator so seen a lot seen

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,210
a lot of successes and seen a lot of

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,500
failures so I'm going to help you just

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,580
understand some of the big mistakes that

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,960
we see some of these companies doing

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,230
based on their cash based on their money

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,930
and so for every business whether it's a

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,480
start-up or a mom-and-pop shop

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
cash is its lifeblood and if you run out

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,190
of cash then the business dies there's

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,690
doesn't really no going back at that

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,520
point and it's actually surprisingly

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,340
easy to run out of cash and we see many

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,579
startups not realize that they they have

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,079
done that until it's too late to

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,850
actually be able to turn it around and

23
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,660
do something about it

24
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,809
so we're going to talk about these three

25
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,579
early-stage pitfalls so this is probably

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,960
most relevant to you right now and then

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,549
we'll talk through another three that as

28
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,810
you start to raise money and are

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,090
starting to think about hiring some

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,700
other other mistakes that companies make

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,570
so we're going to look at what the

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,070
numbers you should be looking at how

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,520
often you should be looking at them

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,200
whether your expenses are realistic and

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,909
then thinking a little bit more about

36
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,290
hiring and looking at responsibilities

37
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,310
alright so let's move on to the first

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,320
one um so the first mistake is really

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,960
not knowing what numbers to look at to

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,979
make sure that the health of your

41
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,520
company is is good and really there are

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,950
three things that you should know your

43
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,530
bank balance the money coming in and the

44
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,930
money going out and these are not

45
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,970
difficult you don't need anything fancy

46
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,860
to be able to do this this is all

47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,390
information you can get from your online

48
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,579
banking or your bank statements you

49
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,079
don't need bookkeepers you don't need

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,899
financial software this is super

51
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,700
straightforward but you would be amazed

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,710
at how many companies don't look at this

53
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,159
and then using these three numbers you

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,780
can then calculate some other things you

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,119
can look at burn you can look at your

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,690
runway you can look at growth rate and

57
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,860
you can figure out whether the company

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,370
default alive okay let's go through

59
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,570
these in order your burn is purely money

60
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,080
in - money out again you can get this

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,340
from your bank statements it's

62
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,500
effectively just the change in bank

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,830
balance between two dates here's an

64
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,780
example super easy

65
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,510
you have 25 K expenses you have 10 K of

66
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,640
revenue so your burn is 15 K if your

67
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,930
expenses are a little bit lumpy some

68
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,220
companies you know you might have a

69
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,100
one-off month where where you I don't

70
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,510
know paid a legal bill or something

71
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,970
that's super high you can do this you

72
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,340
can look to average expenses as well to

73
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,740
figure out your burn and that's often

74
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,420
referred to as average burn so you might

75
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,250
look at this over three months to kind

76
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,900
of get it get more of an idea so then

77
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,850
once you know your burn then you can

78
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,250
start to look at what your runway is and

79
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,260
what this means is how long do you have

80
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,320
until you run out of money and the way

81
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,700
that you calculate that is you look at

82
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,740
your existing bank balance divide it by

83
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,630
your average burn and that gives you a

84
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,140
number of months so here we have 150 K

85
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,500
in the bank we've just calculated our

86
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,800
burn rate to be 15 K and so we have 10

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,430
months of runway again super

88
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,200
straightforward but you'd be amazed at

89
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,850
how many companies or how many founders

90
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,260
don't know these numbers for their

91
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:45,290
company and just a point here that again

92
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,620
the burn might change over time but this

93
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,540
is a number for you this is not a number

94
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,000
to try to make things look good this is

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,489
for you to not lie to yourself so

96
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,860
looking at the burn and going well this

97
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,989
month it was 15 K but let's just pretend

98
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,239
it was 10 K so then that makes it look

99
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,459
like that we have 15 months of runway

100
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,040
left all you're doing is lying to

101
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,570
yourself you're still going to run out

102
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,580
of money on the same day it's just

103
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,160
making you feel better right now so it's

104
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,190
super important to really be honest with

105
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,229
yourself on these you can also look at

106
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,860
your growth rate and so this is just

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,900
looking at two periods of

108
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,840
time so your money in a month to minus

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,669
you money in in month one divided by

110
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,430
your money in a month one so this is

111
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,900
looking at the the rate that your

112
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,330
revenue is increasing so in our example

113
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,530
here we have 10k of revenue in July 12 K

114
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,820
in August and so our growth rate is 20

115
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,729
percent and just a note for the for the

116
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,710
people that weren't the the math whiz

117
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,919
was as at school a constant growth rate

118
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,350
is what's going to give you the J curve

119
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,650
in growth of revenue because if you have

120
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,350
20% growing each month as your numbers

121
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,990
increase each month that 20% caesar is a

122
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,410
larger number okay and then the final

123
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,150
one is whether the company is default

124
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,000
alive or the other the other side of it

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,610
is is it default dead so the way you

126
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,010
calculate this is if your expenses are

127
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,440
constant and your revenue growth that

128
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,169
you've just calculated continues have

129
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,729
you got enough cash to reach

130
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:30,419
profitability and there's a handy little

131
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,400
calculator that Trevor Blackwell who's

132
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,020
one of the founders of Y Combinator

133
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,360
created for you to do this and basically

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,720
there are three things that you can you

135
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,370
can play with so you can look at your

136
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,409
monthly expenses which is the red line

137
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,740
you can look at your monthly revenue

138
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,570
starting point which is the green point

139
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,210
over at the start and then you can

140
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,919
change the gradient of that line to be

141
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,289
your growth rate and it will calculate

142
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,960
where you become profitable and how much

143
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,090
capital is needed now this example isn't

144
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,320
the same numbers as the ones that we've

145
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,849
just been working through so in this

146
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:05,010
example this is assuming that you will

147
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,130
need 150 K of money to get to

148
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,020
profitability and it will take you two

149
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,780
years and so those are really key things

150
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,449
to know because if you only have 100 K

151
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:16,860
of money in your bank account you know

152
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,479
that you've got a problem and you know

153
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,710
that you either need to find a way to

154
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,750
increase your revenue growth or you need

155
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,240
to find a way to cut expenses because

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,310
the whole goal here is to be at the

157
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,229
point where you can find a path to

158
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,010
profitability because it gives you

159
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,139
freedom being profitable gives you

160
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,639
freedom because you aren't in a position

161
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,520
to need to raise money and kind of like

162
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,820
dating if you don't need to raise money

163
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,770
you appear less desperate so your the

164
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,080
investors want to give you money more so

165
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,810
it's easier to raise money so it's

166
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,430
actually really important to have that

167
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,690
option it can sometimes you know it can

168
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,090
be it can be a switch as well you don't

169
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,040
have to necessarily be profitable right

170
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,740
now but if you know that you could turn

171
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,050
off one specific expense or do one

172
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,180
specific thing and be profitable then

173
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,810
that's also a great safety net there's

174
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,730
also a really great essay that talks

175
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,830
about this in more detail this was

176
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,290
written by Paul Graham and you can see

177
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,690
the the link here to where that that

178
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,480
gives you more information on this and

179
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,580
again is the kind of thing that when

180
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,050
we're doing office hours with founders

181
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,340
it's one of the first questions we ask

182
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,380
and you'd be amazed how many people

183
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,650
don't know the answer these numbers

184
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,660
super easy to calculate super

185
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,180
straightforward the next problem is that

186
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,190
people go along and they say ok I've

187
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,810
looked at my runway I've looked at my

188
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,700
revenue I know all my numbers and then

189
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,370
kind of forget about it but actually

190
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,880
this needs to happen pretty often you

191
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,080
shouldn't be looking at it every quarter

192
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,970
or every month you should be looking at

193
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,480
it at least every week and if your

194
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,820
runway is getting low or things are

195
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,150
looking not very constant consistent you

196
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,640
should be looking at it very often like

197
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,430
sometimes daily and whenever anyone asks

198
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,490
you should know your numbers have a have

199
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,640
a think now how many of you know how

200
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,590
much money is in the company bank

201
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,650
account if you already have one great

202
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,970
how much have you know your runway

203
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,530
slightly less number slightly less hands

204
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,330
but that's that's pretty good I like it

205
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm impressed

206
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,340
okay the next one is under representing

207
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,660
your expenses so if you think back to

208
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,830
that default alive' calculator that

209
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,510
assumes that your expenses are going to

210
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,790
remain constant and actually in reality

211
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,400
that's probably unlikely most startups

212
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,590
their expenses will ramp up over time

213
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,320
and you should you should understand how

214
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,960
that's going to happen you know what

215
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,250
kind of expenses are going to increase

216
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,690
and what are they going to increase to

217
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,200
so some examples of

218
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,050
expenses that may change over time is

219
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,149
the first one is undervaluing your own

220
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,130
time particularly in the early days

221
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,740
where you're doing everything and you're

222
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,570
either paying yourself minimum wage or

223
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,490
some very small amount which by the way

224
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,899
in California or everybody should pay

225
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,860
themselves minimum wage and you're also

226
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,990
doing things that don't scale in order

227
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,600
to acquire users and that's totally fine

228
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,860
and that's what we recommend that people

229
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,040
do but it can make your customer

230
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,279
acquisition costs look lower than really

231
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,320
they are and so you should be aware that

232
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,839
over time as you start to hire people to

233
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,870
look into these that those expenses are

234
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,220
going to go up hiring people is not just

235
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,980
their salary for every person that you

236
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,870
hire you need to provide them with

237
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,100
equipment you need probably desk space

238
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,959
you need health insurance probably

239
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,480
depending on where you're based and so

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,490
all of these things cost extra money on

241
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,459
top of the salary and so depending on

242
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,459
location a good rule of thumb is that an

243
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:02,870
employee will cost about 25 to 50

244
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,690
percent more than just their salary so

245
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,180
if they're being paid 100k year then

246
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,490
your fully loaded cost to the company is

247
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,399
going to be somewhere between 125 K 250

248
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,250
K and again that's super easy to forget

249
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,810
about you think oh I'm going to hire an

250
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,490
engineer I'm gonna pay the 100 K that

251
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,079
means you know that's all it's going to

252
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,480
cost but it's it's amazing how those

253
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,190
numbers do add up so just be aware of

254
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,029
those finally assuming paid acquisition

255
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,149
costs remain constant is another another

256
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,120
mistake that we see people make a lot

257
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,709
whilst it may not seem like this often

258
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,470
times in the early days it's actually

259
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,620
easiest to find your early users because

260
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,790
they're the ones that are totally

261
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,440
motivated to use the product and

262
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
actually over time it gets harder to

263
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,029
find and convert users and so the cost

264
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:54,110
of doing that goes up and so again you

265
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,639
know you should be thinking about that

266
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,079
you should be looking at what your costs

267
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,850
are right now and seeing thinking are

268
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,290
they reasonable what do we think they

269
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,360
might go up to because if you can look

270
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,970
at things in the worst case scenario and

271
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,190
you have you know in the worst case

272
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,000
scenario you

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,460
callate that you have eight months of

274
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,250
revenue eight months of runway left but

275
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,500
actually then things are better than

276
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,180
that and you end up with ten months of

277
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,400
revenue then that's bonus right you've

278
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,570
got you've got a bit longer to figure

279
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,030
things out

280
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,310
runway is not a vanity metric it's not

281
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,360
one of these things that's supposed to

282
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,920
make you feel good is not one of the

283
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,430
things that's supposed to be used to

284
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,080
compare yourself against other companies

285
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,970
is for you to know the health of your

286
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,730
company and so don't ignore this stuff

287
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,870
don't lie to yourself don't you know try

288
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,580
to massage these numbers to feel like

289
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,930
it's making yourselves better because

290
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,340
all that's gonna happen is you're

291
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,440
running out of money and it'll become a

292
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,080
shock all right so these ones now are

293
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,850
starting to get a little bit more as you

294
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,380
raise money as you starting to hire

295
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,510
people so it's good to bear in mind

296
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,640
right now but these are probably less

297
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,060
relevant to a lot of you for now okay

298
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,710
the first one is outsourcing

299
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,530
responsibility and often the CEO will

300
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,170
hire a bookkeeper and to prepare the

301
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,090
finances for a company as they start to

302
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,920
get a little bit more complex and that's

303
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,470
a total normal thing to do we recommend

304
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,300
that people do that it's usually once

305
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,950
people raise some money it's not a good

306
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,350
time it's not a good use of the CEOs

307
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,690
time to be doing the books and the CEO

308
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,770
can be doing much more high leverage

309
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,350
things but the things about in mind is

310
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,290
that even though the bookkeeper is doing

311
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,970
the books and preparing those numbers

312
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,780
the responsibility is still everybody's

313
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,940
in the company particularly the CEO but

314
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,040
all the founders everybody should know

315
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,260
what these numbers are an external

316
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,330
bookkeeper isn't going to know the

317
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,400
business like you know the business you

318
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,410
know oftentimes they will the way that

319
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,000
they they work is that they will get

320
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,620
hold of bank statements and they'll see

321
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,820
money coming in and they'll see money

322
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,589
coming out and they'll do their best

323
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:56,570
guess about what these things are and

324
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,910
they won't always be right and you can't

325
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,320
really expect them to always be a

326
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,640
hundred percent right because they're

327
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,080
looking at it from a very removed

328
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,860
position and so it's up to the founders

329
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,490
and it's up to the team to look at those

330
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,320
reports that the bookkeepers send every

331
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,450
month and to make sure that you

332
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,550
understand them and to make sure that if

333
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,810
anything that comes through that looks

334
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,300
strange you question it's not

335
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,590
necessarily

336
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,940
think I think a lot of it is that people

337
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,120
are concerned that asking questions will

338
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,380
make it look like they don't understand

339
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,900
their numbers but usually what happens

340
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,970
is if you don't understand what these

341
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,170
numbers are looking like it's usually

342
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,490
because there's there's been some

343
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,800
misunderstanding in the reporting of the

344
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
numbers and so if you're like well I

345
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,460
thought my revenue was going to be a bit

346
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,990
higher this month for what's going on

347
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,150
why is why is this you know why is this

348
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,340
this number then you can actually go in

349
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,750
and look and query what's what's going

350
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,610
into that and you know you might find

351
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,400
that there has been a mistake made and

352
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,810
this is this is probably one of the

353
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,670
number one things that I get founders

354
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,740
coming to me complaining about they'll

355
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,110
come up to me in this total panic and be

356
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,390
like the bookkeeper messed up and they

357
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,220
told us all this wrong stuff and now I

358
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,230
don't know I have no runway and I don't

359
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,420
know what's going on and actually what

360
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,310
happened is the bookkeeper sent them the

361
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,590
monthly reports they were like tick done

362
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,750
my work founders didn't look at them the

363
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,340
report didn't figure out what was going

364
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,770
on and now there isn't enough time left

365
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,630
for them to turn the business round

366
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,940
either to get profitable or to raise

367
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,880
money to figure things out and the

368
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,530
company dies because it runs out of cash

369
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,890
so super super important to be on this

370
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,430
all the time hiring too quickly and

371
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,760
scaling the company too quickly is it's

372
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,210
really easy to do to hire too quickly

373
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,710
because you're under a lot of pressure

374
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,750
to to hire people it feels like it's a

375
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,630
it's a really easy really measurable

376
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,850
piece of information you know you talk

377
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,050
to founders and one of the first

378
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,200
questions that they will often ask is

379
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,000
also how many employees are you at right

380
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,150
now and you say alright you know I'm at

381
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,830
25 and you're thinking oh no I've only

382
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,330
got 10 employees that means that you

383
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,950
know way more successful than I am and

384
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,140
actually that's totally not true so we

385
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,560
already mentioned that hiring employees

386
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,300
cost more than just their salary but you

387
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,890
should also be conscious that every hire

388
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,810
is actually an investment into the

389
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,400
business and you should be making sure

390
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,260
that you're getting a return on that

391
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,050
investment and now for some types of

392
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,640
employees that's super easy to measure

393
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,649
so you know think about a salesperson

394
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,180
they're not bringing in more sales than

395
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,220
it's costing the business to hire them

396
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,509
then clearly you're not getting a good

397
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,269
return on investment but then think

398
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:45,749
about a community manager or a you know

399
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:49,829
as a support manager it is much harder

400
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,170
to measure that and that's kind of one

401
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,149
of the things that as a CEO you need to

402
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,379
be looking at and you need to be

403
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,300
figuring out to make sure that all the

404
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,160
people in your company are actually

405
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,279
working to make the company more

406
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:05,369
valuable and sadly this is the point

407
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,379
where you know if people aren't working

408
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:10,499
out you should be prepared to fire fast

409
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:12,449
you know if people aren't pulling their

410
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,579
weights then they need to they need to

411
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,009
leave the company and like I say it's

412
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,449
easy to fall into this trap that the

413
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,249
more people you have the better you

414
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:22,679
doing but actually the best companies do

415
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,910
more with less

416
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,819
and so actually the real way that you

417
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,100
should measure yourselves is what's my

418
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,369
ratio of revenue to employees because

419
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,230
the higher that is the better you doing

420
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,579
you're doing more with less

421
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,369
and that's the path to being profitable

422
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:40,470
from an early stage which then takes the

423
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,019
pressure off to the the worry about

424
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,290
whether the company is going to continue

425
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,639
and it's also easy to feel like you have

426
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,199
to kind of compete with with all the

427
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,329
flashy startups that have raised bunches

428
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:52,800
of money and they're all hiring data

429
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,019
scientists right now and you know oh

430
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,639
that means I must need a data scientist

431
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,230
so I'd better hire a data scientist

432
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,199
actually don't you know that the again

433
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,279
the best companies do more with less and

434
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,319
if you can if you can build a really

435
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,149
great company with less employees then

436
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,309
that's amazing for everybody involved

437
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,270
and bear in mind you know you should be

438
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,770
treating this money carefully it's not a

439
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,329
case of just oh I need to hire this

440
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,319
person I need to hire that person

441
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,850
because what the investors who are

442
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,970
giving you this money for they're asking

443
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,279
you to do something basically a miracle

444
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,199
they're asking you to take their money

445
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,899
and turn it into ten or a hundred times

446
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:32,549
that amount of money to give back to

447
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,440
them and the way you're going to do that

448
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,390
is by being careful with your expenses

449
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,929
and making sure that your revenue grows

450
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,149
as a follow-on to that scaling before

451
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,740
you get product market fit is also

452
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,320
another dangerous thing that people fall

453
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,980
into quite easily

454
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,390
at the point where he's still figuring

455
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,440
out what your product is and you're

456
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,450
trying to find product market fit you

457
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,890
should be spending as little as possible

458
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,960
and then that will give you the runway

459
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,180
to have time to figure out what it is

460
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,640
that you you should be building and then

461
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,160
you know people will be beating down the

462
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,340
door to buy your product more employees

463
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,200
will not help you get to product market

464
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,580
fit it will not help you get there

465
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,410
faster it will not help you get there

466
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,280
more efficiently and one of the

467
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,110
conversations that I have with founders

468
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,620
is something along the lines of oh my

469
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,540
sales are low because I don't really

470
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,580
have enough sales people so if I hire

471
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,050
another couple of salespeople they're

472
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,220
marseilles will obviously increase that

473
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,410
doesn't sound like product market fit to

474
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,740
me you know if it if you have that then

475
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,060
customers are beating a path to your

476
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,150
door and you know it it feels like the

477
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,130
wheels are trying to wheels are falling

478
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,300
off as you're trying to look after all

479
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,860
those customers so just hiring more

480
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,540
salespeople isn't necessarily going to

481
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,000
be the thing that sets that going also

482
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,650
convincing yourself that you need more

483
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,840
developers or you need more people to to

484
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,640
get the thing that gives you the the

485
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,130
product market fit another conversation

486
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,300
along this is something like I need for

487
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,670
more developers because then I can build

488
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,210
feature x y&amp;z and then obviously

489
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,940
everybody will buy it but again if you

490
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,980
have product market fit then even your

491
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,470
junk ev0 that doesn't have all of these

492
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,050
fancy things is solving a big enough

493
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,460
problem for everybody that they're

494
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,050
willing to pay for it and they love you

495
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,300
for it anyway and then you can start

496
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,220
building up on the more features and

497
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,280
then you can start hiring to do that

498
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,660
this is this is the one that there's no

499
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,120
coming back from the other ones if you

500
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,620
make these mistakes you can you can

501
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,240
probably solve this Sonique and you know

502
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,560
if you hide too quickly you can figure

503
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,720
that out if you don't know your I spent

504
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,670
I don't know your numbers you can learn

505
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,520
your numbers this is the one that is you

506
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,730
know no going back so if you let your

507
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,820
runway get too low before raising you're

508
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,110
going to have problems raising your

509
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,660
money so the first thing is you should

510
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,870
always assume that you will never raise

511
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,520
any more money always assume that the

512
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,360
previous

513
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,410
money that you raise will be your last

514
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,320
and that you should be aiming to get to

515
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,320
profitability on that money so again the

516
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,670
conversations that I have with founders

517
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,530
where they say oh it's fine my investors

518
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,030
are gonna put in another million dollars

519
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,540
it'll be totally fine that's kind of

520
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,710
scary if you're relying on your

521
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,780
investors to do that because they don't

522
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,000
always sometimes they might but they

523
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,179
don't always so Steve's stage money is

524
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:26,590
the money that you'll raise off and on

525
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,750
just an idea you know you'll be able to

526
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,260
talk to investors about a an idea for a

527
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,090
product you've got a hypothesis that you

528
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,919
you want to be able to check and they

529
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,470
will give you some money once you get to

530
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,690
series a and beyond that becomes much

531
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,460
much harder you know you need sustained

532
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,020
growth you need to have more of an idea

533
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,230
you need to have product market fit this

534
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,480
is why it's a lot harder to raise money

535
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,240
as you go through the life of the

536
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,150
company and in particular don't leave it

537
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,910
too late because if you're running out

538
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,790
of runway your leverage goes down as

539
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,820
you're trying to raise money so if you

540
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,910
have six months of runway let's say and

541
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,020
you think you're about to go and start

542
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,450
raising money that's pretty scary it

543
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,120
could take three months more to actually

544
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,970
get an investor to agree to put money in

545
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,960
and as your cash balances are decreasing

546
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,450
over those three months you know you're

547
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,980
losing leverage you can see from here

548
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,740
that probably at six months you maybe

549
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,650
you can just about pull it off but

550
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,059
really you want to be thinking about 12

551
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,890
months runway that's the point where

552
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,260
you're thinking okay maybe I need to

553
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,580
think about whether I raise money or

554
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,720
whether I'm thinking about getting to

555
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,510
profitability and also if you get to six

556
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,090
months and you're unsuccessful in

557
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,710
raising money you really don't have a

558
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,330
lot of time to turn this around to get

559
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,010
to profitability for the company to

560
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,040
succeed again there's a really great

561
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,500
essay on our blog that goes into this in

562
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,090
more detail linked down here so you can

563
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,340
you can read that at your at your

564
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:00,820
leisure

565
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,890
and hopefully take that on board okay so

566
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,120
in conclusion

567
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,970
most companies die because they run out

568
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,669
of money it's super easy not to run out

569
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:15,200
of money just by looking at

570
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,269
number of things knowing your cash

571
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,909
balance in your runway understanding how

572
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:22,000
your expenses are going to increase

573
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,740
understanding that the ratio of revenue

574
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,720
to employees is a better metric than

575
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,539
just the number of employees and having

576
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:31,460
a plan to get to profitability because

577
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,690
you should assume you're not going to

578
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,929
raise any more money all right thank you

579
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:44,870
very much okay so a few minutes for

580
00:22:44,870 --> 00:23:17,570
questions so the question is how do you

581
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,110
how do you balance the the two sides of

582
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,000
you should do things on a shoestring and

583
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,279
be profitable as early as possible

584
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,779
versus you should just throw money and

585
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:28,990
get market share as fast as possible I

586
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,399
know I think it depends on the stage of

587
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,130
the company as well you know in the

588
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,679
early days then probably being careful

589
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,000
with your money and making sure that you

590
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,519
are you have a plan to get to

591
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,889
profitability is a good thing just

592
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,330
having a plan doesn't mean that you

593
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,889
necessarily have to actually be doing it

594
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,649
you know so so an example might be maybe

595
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:51,260
you're plowing all of your revenues back

596
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,519
into marketing in some description or

597
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,519
rather and knowing that you could

598
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:00,380
actually slow you you you know the way

599
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,870
to the way to reduce your expenses is to

600
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,120
reduce your marketing which might slow

601
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,590
your revenue a little bit but it would

602
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,690
conserve that cash to preserve the

603
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,889
runway it's just it's a balancing act

604
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:14,659
and you know I mean the other thing you

605
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,159
have to bear in mind is that obviously

606
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,649
the investors want you to spend money

607
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:20,240
super fast they want you to come back to

608
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,340
them cap in hand with you know please

609
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,480
please give us more money so there is

610
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,830
that there are some tensions there but

611
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,500
it's all

612
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,270
just being responsible with it and

613
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,640
giving yourself enough time and enough

614
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,309
runway to be able to to figure it out

615
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,520
and I'm just curious at what stage do

616
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,860
you see a four-on-four engulfed in that

617
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,900
company do you start with the quiet exit

618
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,289
CFO first then I can probably see a bow

619
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,240
falls out okay so the question is when

620
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,340
do you bring in a CFO it's surprisingly

621
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,190
late actually even probably post series

622
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,440
a you probably don't need a full-time

623
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,020
CFO at that point and there's a lot of

624
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,059
services that do you know consulting

625
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:07,020
CFOs and and will do will do sort of

626
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,750
strategy or you know help you to figure

627
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,330
out your numbers to raise to create a

628
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,110
deck or whatever for raising money a

629
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,500
full-time CFO is actually pretty late on

630
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,940
just to bear in mind that the difference

631
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,620
between a CFO and a bookkeeper at least

632
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,659
for the for the u.s. is that generally

633
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,130
the way that this works is the

634
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,720
bookkeeper you would you would have

635
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,730
earlier and they're they're the people

636
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,130
who are just going to get your your

637
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,210
numbers that are coming through your

638
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,030
bank statements into a balance sheet

639
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,010
into an income statement into the

640
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,010
accounting system so they're providing

641
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,169
the reports for that and then separately

642
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:46,260
to that you would hire a CPA an

643
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,970
accountant who would prepare the tax

644
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,059
returns and file those for you each year

645
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,230
so there's actually two different sets

646
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,700
of people so a bookkeeper you would need

647
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,490
earlier a CPA you need annually to do

648
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,590
your tax returns and then a CFO who's

649
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,570
going to sort of oversee that and do

650
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,750
more of the building our forecasts

651
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,169
building out budgets and things like

652
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:08,370
that are probably a little bit later on

653
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,990
as well before that it's really the

654
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,610
founders they should be doing it

655
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,970
so so why can you have any calculate it

656
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,510
I mean there are tools online personally

657
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,799
I think it's actually better to build it

658
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,380
yourself because I I think it makes you

659
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,020
think about it in your mind and so

660
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,860
usually just doing good old spreadsheets

661
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,900
for me works well but certainly that

662
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,700
there are other ways that you can you

663
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,340
can do it and there's there's a lot of

664
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,559
services and and a lot of startups we

665
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,850
see a lot of startups applying to us

666
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,100
trying to help to make it easier to see

667
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,850
forecasts and things okay maybe one more

668
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:08,929
question and then we'll move on you have

669
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,220
a product market fit

670
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:19,910
Oh for investors so are you raising seed

671
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,610
stage money yeah okay so at the seed

672
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,890
stage so the question is should you

673
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,650
provide forecasts in your deck if you

674
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,820
haven't reached a product market fit and

675
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,490
the answer is probably no certainly the

676
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,169
seed stage if you're talking to

677
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:34,970
professional investors or experienced

678
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,740
investors they probably aren't really

679
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,049
going to look or ask you for that number

680
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:41,150
they'll they'll ask you for things like

681
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,490
so how could how big could this get and

682
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,080
what's the total market size and you

683
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,220
know questions like that but they're not

684
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,750
going to be looking for here's our

685
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,970
monthly growth predictions probably if

686
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,350
you're being asked those kind of

687
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,049
questions from investors and you're

688
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,220
raising money at the seed stage it

689
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,540
probably means that those investors and

690
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,860
not actually that's experienced at

691
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,770
investing in early-stage companies so

692
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,510
that's a data point for you to decide

693
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,700
whether it's it's a good person to to

694
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,070
work with certainly by the time you get

695
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,500
to series a however you should have you

696
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,090
should have some plans but you know the

697
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,530
point of a Series A is that you've got

698
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,049
product market fit and that you know you

699
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,240
know you have more of an idea I mean

700
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,010
forecasts are always forecasts you don't

701
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,970
know for sure but yeah okay I think we

702
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,450
are up so thank you very much I'm doing

703
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,850
an AMA on Friday so if there's questions

704
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,650
didn't get to then feel free to drop

705
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,120
them in there and I will answer as many

706
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:44,700
as possible of those thank you

707
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,320
you
